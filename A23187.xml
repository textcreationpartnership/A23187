            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But if the bare Name of a King would not ſerve, J could add, that they are the writings of the <hi>Wiſeſt,</hi> the <hi>Learnedſt,</hi> the <hi>Boſt</hi> that ever was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Heathen Kings, if Hiſtorians may be credited. Jt is obſerved by ſome of them as a great argument of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, that ſuch a Prince was provided againſt ſuch times, when all things ſeemed to tend to ruine and confuſion, and all human ordinarie meanes were thought too little to keepe the Empire ſtanding: the happy prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation whereof they generally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the ſingular &amp; extraordinarie <hi>VViſdome</hi> of this One; both in his Warres, abroad; &amp; in his Civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

What ſhall J ſay then of his <hi>Integritie,</hi> which is ſo commended by them, as it alone might well be thought ſufficient without any other commendation, to make him Incomparable? And indeede J feare J have ſpoken but improperly, when J have mentioned his Wiſedome, Learning, &amp; Integritie, as three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Excellencies, ſince that (as he Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe profeſſed, &amp; they report of him) all the Learning he was ambitious of,
<pb facs="tcp:414:4"/>was but to be Wiſe, &amp; all the wiſedome, but to be good. The writings of ſuch a one, J know your Grace would reſpect, although he had beene no King.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Booke (of what worth I ſay not; but more men, I feare, will commend it, then will know how to make uſe of it:) after it had for ſo many ages undeſervedly beene buryed in darkeneſſe: is now firſt; if I may not ſay brought unto light, yet at leaſt made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and intelligible. Twice it is true, within theſe 80. yeares it hath already beene ſet out in its owne originall Greeke: and ſet out both times with a Latin Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, much reviſed and corrected in the latter edition. Yet ſuch are thoſe editions, both of them, ſo confuſed, and ſo corrupt; and ſuch is the Tranſlation in both the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, ſo imperfect often, and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; that I ſay not ſo abſurd and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as that it is not eaſie to determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be harder to underſtand Antoninus his meaning by the Greeke that is printed;
<pb facs="tcp:414:7"/>or the Greeke that is printed, by the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it: but that of both we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and peremptorily conclude; of the one, that it cannot poſſibly bee underſtood, as it is printed; and of the other, that it would be more for the credit of the Author (a man otherwiſe acknowledged very learned:) if wee did take no notice of it at all. I muſt adde beſides, that there hath beene many yeares agoe a certaine Booke, firſt written in Spaniſh, and ſince tranſlated into Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, French, Engliſh, and how many tongues more I know not; pretended by the Title to be a Tranſlation of <hi>M. Aurel. Antoninus.</hi> But that the Author of it, (a learned Spaniard) was in good earneſt, I could never have beleeved, and would have thought I had done him great wrong to ſay it, had not I read his Prefaces, where he ſo earneſtly by reaſons, ſuch as he could finde, goes about to make his Title good, and as earneſtly expoſtulates with men for their incredulity, who did not take his reaſons for current and cleere ones. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but commend his intention, which
<pb facs="tcp:414:7"/>certainely was to doe good; but his way I much abhorre, and wonder as much at his judgement and diſcretion. Sure I am that by his whole booke it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that hee had ever ſo much as ſeene that himſelfe, which his Title doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto others, <hi>M. Aurel. Antoninus</hi> his booke: which either muſt bee this here, or none. For beſides this, there is not any other, that ever was extant. For as for thoſe other writings of his, which either he himſelfe in his ſecond booke, or <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolinus</hi> in his life, or <hi>Nicephorus</hi> in his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Hiſtorie (lib. 3. cap. 31.) or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others mention, they mention them as books written, and compoſed by him, but not as ever publikly extant; which if they had, <hi>Suidas,</hi> or whoſoever they be, whom <hi>Suidas</hi> in his Dictionary, in the word <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> doth alleage, would not have omitted them. Thus much I thought good here briefly to acquaint the Reader with; who if he pleaſe, may receive further ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all the ſeverall ſects and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsions of Philoſophers that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were knowne or heard of in the world, there was not any that ever did hold maximes and opinions ſo contrary to fleſh and blood; never any that was judged even by the learned Heathens themſelves (witneſſe learned Plutarch, who hath written a whole Booke of this very ſubject:) ſo groſſely and manifeſtly to oppoſe nature, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all grounds and principles of humane ſenſe or reaſon, as the Stoicks did. And yet of all ſects and profeſsions, never any, that either with the beſt was of more credit, or with the vulgar more plauſible. So plauſible and popular, that there have beene times,<note place="margin">Lucian in Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motimo, &amp; Is: C. ad iſta Perſ. <hi>Si Cynico barba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> petulans, &amp;c. pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 165.</note> when the number of the Stoicks alone, did exceed all the followers and profeſſors of all other ſects being put together. A thing the more to be wondred at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:414:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>that for that very reaſon, Chriſtianity (though nothing ſo harſh in compariſon:) hath ever by them of contrary profeſsions, beene much oppoſed and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted. Of this a maine reaſon I conceive to have beene, that the Stoicks, though by their particular Tenets and opinions, they might ſeeme of all others moſt to oppoſe nature, yet that which they propoſed unto themſelves as the end of their lives, and the ground of all their Philoſophie; that which they did ever ſound in the eares of men and preſſe them with, was <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>What acruell and unnaturall thing would it bee to reſtraine men from the purſuite of thoſe things, which they conceive to themſelves and their owne nature,<note place="margin">See Ant. B. V. Numb. I.</note> moſt proper and convenient?</hi> So they all ſpeake, and that which they all generally did moſt beate upon, was this. Now whether the particular meanes which they did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend &amp; propoſe unto that end, were indeed proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall unto that end, unto which they did propoſe them, I will not here diſpute. For the end, whether true or pretended, is that which men uſually take moſt notice of. As for the meanes, how direct or indirect to that end, is not ſo eaſilie diſcerned. Their end therefore, being of it ſelfe ſo plauſible and acceptable, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to have beene the thing eſpecially, which made their doctrin and philoſophie ſo too. And I am as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:414:9"/>verily perſwaded, that a conceit and opinion many Chriſtians have, that moſt of thoſe things which are reproved in them as ſinnes and vices, agree beſt with their natures; and many, if not moſt, of thoſe duties that are required of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Chriſtians, are againſt, not depraved and corrupted only, which is not properly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but abſolutely againſt the nature of man: and in generall that divine law and humane ſenſe and reaſon, are things contrary and oppoſite; is that as much as any thing that doth diſcourage them from the intent practice and ſtudy of thoſe things, which they by their profeſsion cannot but acknowledge themſelves bound unto. For it is not more naturall to a man to love <hi>his owne fleſh,</hi> (which the Apoſtle witneſſeth, <hi>no man ever hated:</hi>) then to love nature, and what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to bee according to nature. Though it bee not ſo, yet if hee conceive it ſo, he affects it naturally, and in time it becomes naturall unto him indeed.</p>
            <p>Now concerning Chriſtianity, I know it is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of many, that, matters of Faith and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only excepted, there is nothing in the whole Goſpell which is not <hi>juris naturalis,</hi> and moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to humane reaſon. For my part, as I would not take upon mee,<note place="margin">See Hugo Grot. <hi>de jure Belliac P.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 2. § 6.</note> to maintaine their opinion preciſely true in all points, and circumſtances; ſo I muſt needs ſay, if wee eſteeme that naturall, which naturall men of beſt account by the meere ſtrength of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, have taught and taken upon them to maintaine as juſt and reaſonable, I know not any Euangelicall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or duty belonging to a Chriſtians practice, (even the harſheſt, and thoſe that ſeeme to ordinary men moſt contrary to fleſh and blood, not excepted,) but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:414:10"/>due ſearch and examination, will prove of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I ſay upon due ſearch and examination. Many have touched upon this point, rather to ſhew the way unto others, then by way of undertaking themſelves: among others, of late, the beſt able that I know now living to performe this or any thing elſe that belongs to a generall and compleate Scholler, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hugo Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> in his collection and Tranſlation of Greeke ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. There be too, I know, that have undertaken much in this kinde: but of whom (as many as I have ſeene:) I may boldly ſay (and the more boldly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I name none:) that in many reſpects they have performed but little. I wiſh it with all my heart, that ſome able and judicious man would thinke it worth his labour and paines: were it but to this end, that the harſhneſſe which many Chriſtians (though Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yet fleſh and blood they will ſay) doe conceive to be in many divine precepts, might bee mollified and leſsned, when it ſhall appeare that the very ſame things did not ſeeme harſh to them, that (in compariſon of them whom God hath called by more ſpeciall and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall illumination:) were nothing but fleſh and blood. That they who as men can ſo hardly prevaile upon themſelves to ſtrive againſt nature, and to yeeld to thoſe things which they conceive againſt all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſenſe and reaſon; might be of another minde, when they ſhall ſee that mere naturall men, who in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſenſe and reaſon, of all others moſt excelled, have both eſteemed themſelves bound by nature, and others moſt unnaturall that refuſed, to follow or to forbeare thoſe very things: <hi>ut quivis arbitratur</hi> (ſaith Minutius F. though upon another occaſion)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:414:10"/>
               <hi>aut nunc Chriſtianos philoſophos eſſe, aut phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophos fuiſſe jam tunc Chriſtianos.</hi> But not to proſecute this generall any further at this preſent. Of all Bookes in this kinde that ever have beene written by any Heathens. I know not any which either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of it ſelfe, (for the bulke thereof;) or in regard of the Author, deſerves more reſpect, then this of <hi>Marcus Antoninus;</hi> ſonne by name of Annius Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus (a man of great qualitie in Rome) and adopted ſonne of Antoninus Pius, a Romane Emperour, whom alſo hee ſucceeded in the Empire about the yeare of our Lord <hi>162,</hi> or <hi>163.</hi> The chiefeſt ſubject of the Booke, is, the vanity of the world and all worldly things, as wealth, honour, life, &amp;c. and the end and ſcope of it, to teach a man how to ſubmit himſelfe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Gods providence, and to live content and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in what eſtate or calling ſoever. But the Booke, I doubt not, will ſufficiently commend it ſelfe, to them who ſhall bee able to read it with any judgement, and to compare it with all others of the ſame ſubject, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten either by Chriſtians or Heathens: ſo that it bee remembred that it was written by a Heathen: that is, one that had no other knowledge of any God, then ſuch as was grounded upon naturall reaſons meerely: no certaine aſſurance of the Immortality of the ſoule; no other light whereby he might know what was good or bad, right or wrong, but the light of nature, and humane reaſon. Which though it were, (ſuch as it was) from God the Author of nature (as what is not?) yet inregard it was not by any revelation, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other extraordinary meanes, is therefore called hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and naturall. As for the Booke it ſelfe then, to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:414:11"/>let it ſpeake for it ſelfe; In the Author of it two maine things I conceive very conſiderable, which becauſe by the knowledge of them, the uſe and benefit of the Booke may bee much the greater then otherwiſe it would bee, I would not have any ignorant of. The things are theſe: firſt, that he was a very great man, one that had good experience of what he ſpake; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he was a very good man, one that lived as he did write, and exactly (as farre as was poſsible to a naturall man,) performed what hee exhorted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unto.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, I have alwayes thought that it was not without Gods eſpeciall Providence, that of all them that once were the peculiar people of God, hee was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to write againſt the vaine pleaſures and delights of this world, who of all the reſt had had moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience of thoſe things, that hee did write againſt. A poore man may from his heart per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance declaime againſt the vanity of wealth, and pleaſures; and a private man, againſt the vanity of honour, and greatneſſe; it may be from their hearts, but it is ever ſuſpicious, and therefore of leſſe power and efficacie. Suſpicious I meane, that they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with that they would faine, and cannot get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yea, and perchance inveigh of purpoſe, that by inveighing (an ordinary thing in the world:) they may get that which they inveigh againſt. But at the beſt, that they make a vertue of neceſsitie; that they ſpeake againſt they know not what; and though they meane ſincerely, as now; yet if they were in place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, God knowes what minde they would be of. And the event indeed, doth juſtifiie theſe ſuſpicions
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:414:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>but too often. But when a man ſhall heare ſuch a one as Salomon was, ſpeaking in this manner: <hi>I ſaid in my heart, Goe to now, I will proove thee with mirth &amp;c. I made me great workes, &amp;c. I made mee gardens and orchards, &amp;c. I made me pooles of water, &amp;c. I got mee ſervants and maidens, &amp;c. I gathered mee ſilver and gold, &amp;c. So I was great, &amp;c. And whatſoever mine eyes deſired, I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy, &amp;c. Then I looked on all the workes that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to doe; and behold, all was vanitie and vexation of ſpirit, and there was no profit under the Sunne.</hi> Is there any man ſo bewitched, and beſotted with worldly wealth and pleaſure, whom ſuch a confeſsion from ſuch a one, will not move for a while at the leaſt? And if this of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, who at firſt had received ſuch meaſure of Grace and illumination from God, that it may be more juſtly wondred, that he ever did any thing contrary to this profeſsion, then that he ſhould profeſſe ſo much; how much more ſhould that confeſsion of Antoninus move us, dilated here by him and inlarged into XII. bookes and briefly expreſſed and ſummed up in theſe words of his eight Booke.<note place="margin">B. VIII. N. I.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Thou haſt already had ſufficient experience, that of all the things that hitherto thou haſt wandred and erred about, thou couldſt not finde happineſſe in any of them: not in ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes, and Logicall ſubtilties; not in wealth, not in honour and reputation; not in pleaſure: in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:414:12"/>none of all theſe.</hi> Of Antoninus I ſay, a meere Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, lead by humane reaſon only; Antoninus a man for worldly wealth and greatneſſe ſo farre greater then Salomon, as Lord and Maſter I dare ſay of more great Kingdomes, then Salomon was of great townes in all his Kingdome; Antoninus, a man for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wiſedome, by all men during his life, had in that honour and reputation, as never man either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him was, or (that wee know of) ever after him.</p>
            <p>But his goodneſſe was the ſecond conſideration. It hath ever beene the complaint of all ages: There hath ever beene ſtore enough of men that could ſpeake well, and give good inſtructions: But great want of them that either could, or ſo much as endeavoured, to doe as they ſpake and taught others to doe. And what is the good that ſuch can doe? The only good I can conceive, is, that they perſwade men as much as in them lies (and they goe very effectually about it:) that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>That all this that we call vertue and godlineſſe, ſo much ſpoken of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, are but words and emptie ſounds; that there is no ſuch thing really exiſtent indeed, as piety and juſtice, but that it is a meere fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome cunning juglers and impoſtors, or at the beſt a pretty device of Law-makers, and founders of common-wealths, to keepe ſilly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in awe and feare.</hi> Can any man thinke other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (if otherwiſe he be not better grounded:) that ſhall heare them ſpeake and then looke upon their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:414:12"/>Such therefore in my judgement might deſerve farre more thankes if they did forbeare, and would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe the commendations of either a ſmooth tongue, or a ready pen, then to incurre both the juſt ſuſpicion of being Atheiſts themſelves, and the certaine guilt and crime of having made many others ſo. Bee it therefore ſpoken to the immortall praiſe and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this famous Antoninus, that as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> did write ſo he did live. Never did writers ſo conſpire to give all poſsible teſtimonie of goodneſſe, uprightneſſe, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and whatſoever could among Heathens be moſt commendable, as they have done to commend this One. They commend him, not as the beſt Prince on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but abſolutely as the beſt man, and beſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher that ever was. And it is his proper commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that being ſo commended, hee is commended without exception. If any thing hath ever beene tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked againſt him, the Hiſtorians mention it but as a talke: not credited by them nor by any that ever were of any credit. Thus the Heathens of Him. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had but little reaſon to ſpeake well of him, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuffered many cruell perſecutions under him: And in this caſe how free they have beene (ſome of them:) even with all extremity to enveigh againſt other Emperors, though much commended and magnified by the Heathens, is not unknowne. Yet I find not that ever they could faſten any thing upon our Antoninus, whereby to ſtaine his reputation; that ever they did ſo much as object unto Him, theſe many and grievous perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which they did ſuffer under him, as his owne act, or charge Him therefore of crueltie. And though it be granted, that Antoninus gave way
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:414:13"/>to thoſe perſecutions, which certainly he could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together be ignorant of; yet to them that know the ſtate of thoſe dayes, it can be no wonder, that ſuch a thing ſhould happen in the dayes of ſuch a Prince as Antoninus was. When Chriſtians, beſides the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of many horrible crimes, as common inceſt, homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, &amp;c. which (ſuch was the power of calumny:) lay upon them; were generally accounted no better, then meere Atheiſts and Epicures. For indeed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Epicures,</hi> were commonly joyned together as names, if not of the ſame ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet of very great affinity, and hardly diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the vulgar, but that of the three, the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> was thought the worſt. Let it be then Antoninus his commendation, the greater and the more incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this age, the more the age is full of diſsimulation and hypocriſie, that hee was not (as now they rightly ſtile themſelves, whom the common received Names of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will not content, ſuch is their <hi>Zeale</hi> and <hi>puritie</hi> they thinke:) a <hi>Profeſſor:</hi> as he ſpake and wrote, ſo he did. His meditations were his actions. His deeds (ſo ſtill you remember Him a man and a Heathen:) did agree with his ſentences. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And againe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. That hee did not only as he ſpake, but what he did, he did it out of meere love to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. That it was a cleere caſe, which no man doubted of, that hee was in very deed a good man; ſo incapable was he of any diſſimulation.</hi> So Dio of him, and ſo others. And now that I have ſpoken ſo much of Antoninus his life, it will not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:414:13"/>to ſay ſomewhat of that ſurname the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> which by many hath beene given and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to this Emperor. In ſo much as Xylander, though he found it not at all (as hee confeſſeth) in his MS. yet thought it fitting to adde it in the Title, and Inſcription of theſe bookes as his proper and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Cognomen. But ſure enough it is (as hath beene obſerved by learned men:) that this Title of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher</hi> was never taken by Antoninus himſelfe, nor given unto him by others, as a proper ſurname, as his father Antoninus was ſurnamed <hi>PIUS,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers otherwiſe, but only as a deſerved Elogium and teſtimonie, at the diſcretion of them that either did ſpeake unto Him, or wrote of Him. And ſo indeed it was very commonly, and even by thoſe learned and Pious Chriſtians, that directed Apologies unto Him for the Chriſtians, adſcribed unto him as an Elogium, and Teſtimonie: juſt indeed and deſerved, but arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and not proper unto Him, by way of a Cognomen or ſurname.</p>
            <p>But, an Elogium and teſtimony of what think you? of his great learning (as we take learning now;) and progreſſe in the Sciences? Read him himſelfe, and judge how much he would have eſteemed ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. A man would thinke, if Heathens, through their ignorance of the true God, and of his truth, had beene miſtaken in the true application of words of praiſe or diſpraiſe, that wee, by the helpe of a better light, might have rectified them, and not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their examples. But now it is fallen out quite contrary. Who they be that the holy Scriptures uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call <hi>wiſe;</hi> who they to whom they adſcribe <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:414:14"/>and <hi>underſtanding;</hi> and who they are, who by them are termed <hi>fooles, blinde, ignorant,</hi> and the like, is not unknowne unto any. So ſpake the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Heathens, when they would ſpeake properly. He that was an honeſt upright, vertuous man, without diſsimulation and hypocriſie, though hee were ſuch a one as had never beene brought up to learning, yea ſuch a one as could neither read nor write, was their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> their good ſcholler, their learned man, their Philoſopher. His life and his actions, were all that they ſtood upon, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were of opinion, that it was very difficult, if not altogether impoſsible, for a man to come to the knowledge, of that which was right and wrong, juſt or unjuſt, and by conſequent of true vertue, without much ſtudie and paines taking. On the other ſide, an unjuſt man, a cunning, an intemperate; in generall, a vicious man, was their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> their Illiterate, their Ignorant, their Idiot. The moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſtinction was, of an <hi>Idiot,</hi> and a <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</hi> Neither was this the proper language of the Stoicks (which ſect our Antoninus was much addicted unto:) but of the Platonicks likewiſe, and of moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But the maine and principall property, whereby they did diſtinguiſh a Philoſopher from all other men, was that he did all things <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto God and his Providence; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as Epictetus (in Arrianus) ſpeaketh. This you ſhall finde that Antoninus doth much ſtand upon. For indeed they did eſteeme it the very character and eſſentiall note of a philoſopher. In ſo much as that if any man ſeemed never ſo juſt and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:414:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>upright in his actions, yet if it were not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they eſteemed him little more then a meere Idiot.</p>
            <p>Much more I had here to ſay concerning this matter, both in defence of Plato (whoſe name hath much ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered through ſome mens ignorance of the true ſenſe of this word <hi>Philoſophus</hi>) and for the clearing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obſcure places of Antoninus, which otherwiſe I thinke will hardly be underſtood. But becauſe I feare it would make the bodie of this Preface to ſwell too much beyond the proportion of the reſt,<note place="margin">See Notes upon B. VIII. N. I.</note> and that in the Notes it will come in well enough, I will reſerve it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that place.</p>
            <p>Now for this my Tranſlation of Antoninus, which is the laſt thing wee are to ſpeake of, were it ſo that this Booke were as commonly knowne, and as eaſie to be got as many others of leſſe worth are, I ſhould bee well content to ſpare my labour, and referre it wholly to the judgement of the Reader. But for as much as by my owne experience I know the Booke, (though twice printed,) to be ſo rare, that it is not to bee found in many private ſtudies, and ſometimes not for many yeares together, in any Booke-ſellers ſhop: (I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to learned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Holſworths well furniſhed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary for the firſt ſight, and long uſe of the latter and better Edition; as alſo for the uſe of many other Bookes:) and that the Latine Tranſlation of Xylan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hath beene commended and approved by the moſt learned (<hi>doctiſſimus; eruditiſſimus Interpres; vir profundae eruditionis, &amp;c.</hi> So they ſpeake of him:) I doe thinke it very neceſſary, both that I ſhould give the Reader that ſatisfaction, that I doe not <hi>actum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi> and doe my ſelfe that right, that whereas I take
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:414:15"/>upon me to tranſlate <hi>Marcus Antoninus Auguſtus,</hi> I may not be ſuſpected to have tranſlated <hi>Guilielmus Xylander Auguſtanus.</hi> Indeed what might bee expected from Xylanders Interpretation, may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by his owne ingenuous intimation, both in his Preface, where he is faine to Apologize for it, that he durſt undertake it, profeſsing that <hi>in quibuſdam</hi> hee was conſtrained, to <hi>divinare &amp; audacter à codice Graeco aut uſu communi recedere;</hi> as alſo in his Notes, where his words are, <hi>Sunt autem paſſim per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multa, in quibus ariolo magis quam Interprete opus ſit:</hi> And that he doth ſo indeed, it doth but too manifeſtly appeare by his Tranſlation. For I dare boldly ſay, and doe him no wrong, that ſometimes in a whole page, he hath not two lines of Antoninus his ſenſe, and meaning. Beſides the liberty that hee takes unto himſelfe to ſupply of his owne head, to leave out ſometimes words, ſometimes lines, to change and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at his will; without any reaſon given for it, or ſo much as the Reader acquainted with it. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Xylander puts the fault of all this upon the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and imperfection of the copie, I cannot any wayes approve it. For firſt, as I confeſſe the faults and corruptions of it, if in the printed copies they have not beene made more, then they were in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript (which I doe not beleeve:) to be many, ſo of thoſe many, I know none or very few, that may be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med incurable. And as for the <hi>Lacunae</hi> of it, I hope that they neither in this Tranſlation (and what anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent booke is there almoſt but hath ſome?) will not bee found many. As for any greater <hi>hiatus,</hi> as perchance of many leafes together, if any ſhall ſuſpect the Copie
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:414:15"/>to have beene defective in that kinde, the method and compoſition of the booke being ſuch, that it doth for the moſt part conſiſt of certaine Aphoriſmes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, (they called them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) without any certaine order or <hi>ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> either in regard of the whole (but that they all tend to one purpoſe;) or in regard of the parts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: as it is not poſsible by the matter it ſelfe for any man, to determine how much more in this kinde may have beene written by Antoninus; ſo if there were never ſo much extant, yet how this that we have here, could thereby be made more perfect then it is, I doe not ſee. Their conceit, who by reaſon of this unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of matters, would have the whole booke to be but excerpts and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of a greater, and better compacted worke; there being ſo many other bookes both ſacred and prophane written in the ſame kinde; and Epictetus (the Patterne of all latter Stoicks:) his Enchiridion among the reſt, it can at the beſt paſſe but for a meere conceit, and needs I hope no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.</p>
            <p>To tell you then what I have done, and that you may be the better ſatisfied that I except not againſt Xylanders Interpretation without cauſe, it remaines that for a <hi>Specimen</hi> I produce ſome few paſſages, by which it will be eaſie for any to judge of the reſt. But firſt I muſt faithfully profeſſe that my purpoſe in all this is not any wayes to detract, either from Xylander himſelfe, or from the judgement of thoſe learned men, by whom he hath beene highly commended, but rather to follow (after my beſt abilitie:) Xylanders owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; whom for his great paines, and labour in his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:414:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>life-time to further and promote learning, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to have deſerved much honour &amp; reſpect from all that love learning. I might adde that I ſhall deal with him more ingenuouſly too, then ſome others have done, who take upon them to correct ſome corrupt places of Antoninus, which Xylander in his Tranſlation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they take no notice, had already plainly corrected. But now to Antoninus.</p>

            <p>An eaſie matter it were to adde to theſe many more ſuch paſſages, if I thought it as neceſſary, as it would be eaſie. They that ſhall take the paines (and it will be worth their paines I dare promiſe them) to compare diligently the Tranſlations with Antoninus himſelfe, will, I doubt not, before they have gone one or two Bookes over, be of my minde. I have of purpoſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:414:19"/>made choiſe of ſuch places eſpecially, where I have made bold ſomewhat to correct the Text. I ſay bold, but no bolder I will maintain, then any reaſonable man muſt, and ought, that doth undertake any ſuch work. For I have not (to my knowledge:) by my Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on altered any one place in this kinde in the whole booke, but ſuch as by certaine proofes and demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Antoninus himſelfe, I can maintaine. Thoſe places that I thought any thing doubtfull, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven account of them to the Reader in my Notes. And if I have left any for deſperate, as either imperfect or not intelligible by me, I may truly ſay, that had I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to my ſelfe but the tenth part of the libertie, which Xylander doth uſually throughout the whole book; I nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to have left any ſuch places at all. And I make no queſtion, but that in ſo doing, I might have given to many content and ſatisfaction good enough. But conſidering how much this libertie is commonly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and how prejudiciall it proves to good Authors, I have rather choſen ſometimes to ſay leſſe then I might, then to give unto others an example of this bold kinde of dealing with ancient Authors. The chiefeſt ground of all the obſcurity in the Booke, is, that Antoninus having beene all his life an indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable ſtudent, and ſo read a world of writers of all ſorts, his manner is in theſe his bookes, as he rend any thing that made for his preſent purpoſe, cloſely and briefly to allude unto it, by ſome ſhort meditation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: ſometimes barely to excerpt ſome words, which either he had an eſpeciall liking unto, or afterward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended further to meditate upon, without any mention of the place or Author from whence they are taken.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:414:19"/>Now many of theſe Authors being quite periſhed, many of his alluſions ſo cloſe and obſcure, that though the Authors be yet extant, yet it is not eaſie to finde from whence, or of whom, nor to what intent or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: it muſt not be wondred, if not only many places ſeeme obſcure, but ſome alſo of little worth and uſe; becauſe, it doth not appeare, what further uſe Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus had of them in his minde. Howſoever to them that are any thing verſed in the writings of ancient Philoſophers, Stoicks eſpecially, there will not occurre many ſuch places. If a man take but Arrianus, and Seneca, and compare them diligently with Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, he will finde a marvellous conſent, and many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure ſhort places of Antoninus, illuſtrated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by their larger diſcourſe. I have done it in ſome few places, which I thought could not well other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be underſtood. And for the reſt, I leave them to every diligent Readers induſtrie. Neither indeed would I have put my ſelfe to the labour of writing any Notes at all, if the booke could as well have wanted them, as I could eaſilie have found as well, or better to my minde, how to beſtow my time. However as I thought ſome would be needfull, ſo did I thinke alſo, that if in the former Bookes, I did give ſatisfaction to the Reader, I might afterwards be ſpared, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be truſted my ſelfe, or truſt to the Readers dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and abilitie for the reſt. Whereſoever by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a word or two in the Text, I thought I could helpe the ſenſe, and illuſtrate the matter ſufficiently; to ſpare my ſelfe a Note, and for the eaſe of the Reader, I have done it. All ſuch additions to the Text, you ſhall finde within two ſuch [] markes included. And
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:414:20"/>whereas thoſe former paſſages by me produced wherein I except againſt the Latine Tranſlation, are all ſuch as could not be well tranſlated without ſome correction of the Text, that it may not bee thought, that in ſuch places only it is amiſſe, I have for the further ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Reader (the bookes as hath already been ſaid, being ſo ſcarce and hard to become by:) taken occaſion in my Notes, now and then to inſtance in ſome other paſſages, wherein there can be no ſuch exception. In the Author himſelfe I feare exception will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, at many places, as meere repetitions; at ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, wherein he ſeemeth to contradict what hee had ſaid before. But if the Readers conſider, firſt, that what Antoninus wrote, he wrote it not for the publick, but for his owne private uſe; and ſecondly, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus his words are ſo intermingled every where with his <hi>Excerpta</hi> that it doth not well appeare what is his owne, and what is not; as in regard of the firſt conſideration they will, I doubt not, allow him farre more libertie then otherwiſe were fitting: ſo in regard of the ſecond, I preſume they will yeeld both thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuſpected repetitions in the Bookes, and thoſe few ſuppoſed contradictions, the one perchance to be but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall collections of one ſubject and to one purpoſe from ſeverall Authors; and the others certainely, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the different opinions of different Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame thing, then the contradictions of one man, inconſtant to himſelfe. And as for ſuch places which may give offence, as repugnant to our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, and impious; as when hee ſeemeth to ſpeake doubtfully of God, and his Providence; and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe all things to Fatall neceſsity, and the like: I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:414:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhall but deſire the Readers to remember who hee was that wrote, and I hope they will deſire no other ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in this point. For that any Chriſtian ſhould expect from any out of the Church and without the Scriptures perfect ſound knowledge in theſe high points would be no ſmall wonder to mee: it being both the happineſſe of every the meaneſt Chriſtian, that he may know more in theſe myſteries, then the greateſt Philoſophers could ever, with all their wit and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning attaine unto; and the proper priviledge of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Scriptures, that from them only all ſolid truth in points of this nature, is to be expected. However that Antoninus may not want any juſt defence that his cauſe doth afford, the Reader muſt further be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to judge of his opinions, by one or two ſhort paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages here and there, occurrent, which whether they be his or no (as we have already ſaid) is hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but to have a reſpect to other more large, and peremptory paſſages concerning the ſame purpoſe elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to be found. As for example concerning God and his Providence, to B. II. Num. VIII. B. V I. Num. XXXIX. &amp;c. and concerning Fatall neceſsitie not only to the ſame Lib. II. Num. VIII. but alſo to divers other places, as B. VIII. Num. 6.27.30.32.46. &amp;c. by which places as it doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that he doth exclude all manner of Neceſsitie from humane wils and actions, ſo doth it appeare by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages, as Lib. <hi>8</hi> Num. <hi>33.</hi> that he did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together exclude from all divine providence not even thoſe actions of men, that are moſt contrary to the will of God: from which place moreover may appeare what it is that he often calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Fate,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny;</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:414:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>which in his meaning is no other then (as by divers other Philoſophers alſo it is expounded) Gods order and providence in matters of the world: to which purpoſe hee doth alſo expound the word <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> B. I. Num. XVII. On the other ſide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he doth every where very abſolutely maintaine this libertie of mans will, and that he was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the myſterie of originall ſinne, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall concupiſcence; yet ſhall you not finde in him thoſe blaſphemies, in exaltation of this humane power and libertie, which you ſhall in Seneca, and other Stoicks: neither did he (it ſhould ſeeme, though but an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then:) ſo much rely upon it, but that he doth very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly commend prayers, as very powerfull and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all unto vertue. See lib. IX. Num. XL. Now if An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus himſelfe being a Romane, for the propriety and facilitie of his expreſsions (wherein the Latine tongue, in matter of Philoſophie, comes as ſhort of the Greeke, as the Engliſh doth of the Latine:) did in the compoſing of theſe his Bookes preferre the Greeke tongue before his owne mother tongue; no man I hope will expect, that all things ſhould in this Tranſlation runne ſo ſmoothly, as in another kinde of Tranſlation happily they might. But herein I muſt confeſſe my feare is for Antoninus, more then for my ſelfe. For firſt whereas he, being (I thinke) as well acquainted with ancient writers and philoſophers as ever any was, doth every where very ſtrictly and carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their proper choiſe words and termes, which both make the ſenſe it ſelfe more current, and pleaſing; and for a Scholler to know them and to be acquainted with them, is in many reſpects very uſefull; This in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:414:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Tranſlation muſt needs be loſt, and by conſequent ſo much loſt to Antoninus, of his due praiſe and commendation. And ſecondly, whereas in all theſe his XII. bookes there be not many lines (if any:) which if well conſidered, will not be found either to be taken out of ſome ancient Author, or at leaſt by way either of Exception, Confirmation, Illuſtration, and the like, to either paſſage or opinion of ſome ancient to have ſome relation; as to Schollars I know whatſoever is in this kinde, be it otherwiſe what it will, cannot but bee acceptable and uſefull, ſo to others I feare, many things for want of this uſe of it, which they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, will ſeeme but drie and impertinent. In theſe two reſpects I cannot deny but I have done Antoninus ſome wrong to make him ſo vulgar, as I have done, and yet becauſe I thought hee might in other reſpects doe good to any that ſhould read him, if before the credit of one I have preferred the good of many I have but done what Antoninus himſelfe (as by theſe his bookes may appeare:) would have me or any others doe in the like caſe.</p>
            <p>And now in the laſt place, if any ſhall by theſe my paines receive any content, my deſire is that they would thanke him, by whoſe encouragement eſpecially I did undertake this little worke, my Reverend Kinde friend D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

That I was not long brought up by the Concubine of my Father; that I preſerved the flower of my youth. That I tooke not upon me to be a man before my time, but rather put it off longer then I needed. That I lived under the government of my Lord and Father, who would take away from me all pride and vaine-glory, and reduce me to that conceit and opinion that it was not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>[for a Prince]</hi> to live in the Court <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> without a troope of guards and followers, extraordinary

That I have had ſuch a Brother, who by his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample might ſtirre mee up to thinke of my ſelfe; and by his reſpect and love, delight and pleaſe me. That I have got ingenuous children, and that they were not borne diſtorted, nor with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other naturall deformity. That I was no great proficient in the ſtudy of Rhetorick and Poetry, and of other faculties, which perchance I might have dwelt upon, if I had found my ſelfe to goe on in them with ſucceſſe. That I did by times preferre thoſe, by whom I was brought up, to ſuch places and dignities, which they ſeemed unto me moſt to deſire; &amp; that I did not put them off with hope and expectation, that (ſince that they were yet but yong:) I would doe the ſame hereafter. That I ever knew Apollonius, and Ruſticus, and Maximus. That I have had occaſion often and effectually to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and meditate with my ſelfe, concerning that life which is according to nature, what the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and manner of it is: So <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> that as for the gods and ſuch Suggeſtions, helpes and inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as might be expected from them, nothing did hinder, but that I might have begunne long before to live according to nature; or that even

For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this latter may ſeeme firſt to have beene wronged, and ſo in ſome manner through griefe thereof to have been forced to be angry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he who through luſt doth commit any thing, did of himſelfe meerly reſolve upon that action.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Whatſoever thou doeſt affect, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou doeſt project, ſo doe, and ſo project all, as one who, for ought thou knoweſt, may at this very preſent depart out of this life. And as for death, if there be any gods, it is no grievous thing to leave the ſociety of men. The gods will doe thee no hurt thou maiſt be ſure. But if it be ſo that there be no gods, or that they take no care of the world, why ſhould I deſire to live in a world void of gods, and of all divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? But gods there be certainely, and they take care for the world; and as for thoſe things which be truly evill, as vice and wickedneſſe; ſuch things they have put in a mans owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he might avoid them if he would: and had there beene any thing beſides that had been truly bad and evill, they would have had a care of that alſo, that a man might have avoided it.

If thou ſhouldſt live 3000, or as many 10000 of yeares, yet remember this,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that man can part with no life properly, ſave with that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle part of life, which hee now lives: and that which he lives, is no other, then that which at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very inſtant he parts with. That then which is longeſt of duration, and that which is ſhorteſt, come both to one effect. For although in regard of that which is already paſt there may be ſome inequalitie, yet that time which is now preſent and in being, is equall unto all men. And that being it which wee part with <hi>[whenſoever we die,]</hi> it doth manifeſtly appeare, that it can bee but a moment of time, that wee then part with. For as for that which is either paſt or to come, a man cannot be ſaid properly to part with it. For how ſhould a man part with that which he hath not? Theſe two things therefore thou muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.

            <p n="14">XIV. A mans ſoule doth wrong and diſreſpect it ſelfe firſt and eſpecially, when as much as in it ſelfe lyes it becomes an <hi>Apoſteme,</hi> and as it were an excreſcencie of the world, for to be grieved and diſpleaſed with any thing that happens in the world, is direct <hi>apoſtaſie</hi> from the Nature of the Univerſe, part of which, all particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the world, are: Secondly, when ſhee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is averſe from any man, or lead by contrary deſires and affections, tending to his hurt and prejudice; ſuch as are the ſoules of them that are angry.

Fiftly, when ſhee doth either affect or endeavour any thing to no certain end, but raſhly and without due ratiocination, and conſideration, how conſequent or inconſequent it is to the common end.

            <p n="15">XV. The time of a mans life is as a point; the

Our life is a warfare, and a meere pilgrimage. Fame after life, is no better then oblivion. What is it then that will adhere and follow? One only thing, Philoſophy. And philoſophie doth conſiſt in this, for a man to preſerve that Spirit which is within him, from all manner of contumelies and injuries, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all paines or pleaſures; never to doe any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either raſhly, or fainedly, or hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: Wholly to depend from himſelfe, and his owne proper actions: all things that happen unto him to embrace contentedly, as comming from Him from whom He Himſelfe alſo came; and above all things, with all meekneſſe and a calme chearefulneſſe, to expect death, as being nothing elſe, but the reſolution of thoſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of which every creature is compoſed.

The hanging downe of grapes, the brow of a Lyon; the froath of a foaming wilde boare, and many other like things, though by themſelves conſidered, they are farre from any beautie, yet becauſe they happen naturally, they both are comely, and delightfull; ſo that if a man ſhall with a profound minde and apprehenſion, conſider all things in the world, even among all thoſe things which are but meere acceſſories, and naturall <hi>appendices</hi> as it were, there will ſcarce appeare any thing unto him, wherin he will not finde matter of pleaſure and delight.

But ſuppoſe that both they that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee, and thy memory with them ſhould be immortall, what is that to thee?

That which is faire and goodly, whatſoever it be, and in what reſpect ſoever it be, that it is faire and goodly, it is ſo of it ſelfe, and terminates in it ſelfe, not admitting praiſe as a part or member: that therefore which is praiſed, is not thereby made either better or worſe. This I underſtand even of thoſe things, that are commonly called faire and good, as thoſe which are commended either for the matter it ſelfe, or for curious workmanſhip. As for that which is truly good, what can it ſtand in need of more, then either Law or Truth; or more then either kindneſſe and modeſtie? Which of all thoſe, either becomes good or faire, becauſe commended; or diſpraiſed ſuffers any dammage? Doth the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald become worſe in it ſelfe, or more vile if it bee not commended? Doth gold, or yvory, or purple?

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:414:46"/>bodies of them that are buried? For as here the change and reſolution of dead bodyes into another kinde of ſubſiſtence, (whatſoever it be;) makes place for other dead bodies: ſo the ſoules after death transferred into the aire, after they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed there a while, are either by way of tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or transfuſion, or conflagration, received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into that originall rationall ſubſtance, from which all others doe proceed: and ſo give way to thoſe ſoules, who before coupled and aſſociated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bodyes, <hi>[now beginne to ſubſiſt ſingle.]</hi> This, upon a ſuppoſition that the ſoules after death doe for a while ſubſiſt ſingle, may be anſwered. And here, (beſides the number of bodies, ſo buried and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the earth,) wee may further conſider the number of ſeverall beaſts, eaten by us men, and by other creatures. For notwithſtanding that ſuch a multitude of them is daily conſumed, and as it were buried in the bodyes of the eaters, yet is the ſame place and body able to containe them, by reaſon of their converſion, partly into blood, partly into aire and fire. What in theſe things is the ſpeculation of truth? to divide things into that which is paſſive, and materiall; and that which is active and formall.</p>

For ſince it is ſo, that moſt of thoſe things, which wee either ſpeake or doe, are unneceſſary; if a man ſhall cut them off, it muſt needs follow that he ſhall thereby gaine much leiſure, and ſave much trouble, and therefore at every action a man muſt privately by way of admonition ſuggeſt unto himſelfe, What? may not this that now I goe about, be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of unneceſſary actions?

In the like manner conſider other periods, both of times, and of whole nations, and ſee how many men, after they had with all their might and main intended, and proſecuted ſome one worldly thing or other, did ſoone after drop away, and were reſolved into the Elements.

What have they got more, then they whoſe deaths have beene un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely? Are not they themſelves dead at the laſt? as Cadicianus, Fabius, Julianus, Lepidus, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who in their life time having buried many; were at the laſt buried themſelves. The whole ſpace of any mans life, is but little; and as little as it is, with what troubles, with what manner of diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in the ſociety of how wretched a body muſt it be paſſed? Let it be therefore unto thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as a matter of indifferencie.

Am I then yet unwilling to goe about that, for which I my ſelfe was borne and brought forth into this world? Or was I made for this, to lay me downe, and make much of my ſelfe in a warme bed? O but this is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. And was it then for this that thou wert borne, that thou mighteſt enjoy pleaſure? Was it not in very truth for this, that thou mighteſt <hi>[alwayes]</hi> be buſie and in action? Seeſt thou not <hi>[how all things in the world be ſides,]</hi> how every tree and plant, how ſparrowes and ants, ſpiders and bees: how all in their kinde are intent <hi>[as it were] orderly</hi> to performe whatſoever (towards the preſervation of this <hi>order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Univerſe; or, <hi>of this Vniverſe, which doth conſiſt of Order</hi>) naturally doth become and belong unto them? And wilt not thou doe that, which belongs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto a man to doe? Wilt not thou runne to doe that, which thy nature doth require? But thou muſt have ſome reſt. Yes, thou muſt. Nature hath of that alſo, as well as of eating and drinking, allowed thee a certaine ſtint. But thou goeſt beyond thy
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:414:52"/>ſtint, and beyond that which would ſuffice, &amp; in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of action, there thou comeſt ſhort of that which thou maiſt. It muſt needs be therefore, that thoudoſt not love thy ſelfe, for if thou didſt, thou wouldſt alſo love thy Nature, &amp; that which thy nature doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe unto her ſelf as her end. Others, as many as take pleaſure in their trade and profeſſion, can even pine themſelves at their workes, and neglect their bodies and their food for it; and doeſt thou leſſe honour thy nature, then an ordinary mechanick his trade, or a good dancer his art? then a covetous man his ſilver, and a vaine glorious man applauſe? Theſe to whatſoever they take an affection, can be content to want their meat and ſleepe, to further that every one which he affects: and ſhall actions tending to the common good of humane ſocietie, ſeeme more vile unto thee, or worthy of leſſe reſpect, and intention?</p>

If it be right and honeſt to be ſpoken or done, undervalue not thy ſelfe ſo much, as to be diſcouraged from it.

Or wilt thou ſay, that it is through defect of thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conſtitution, that thou art conſtrained to murmur, to be baſe and wretched, to flatter; now to accuſe, and now topleaſe, and pacifie thy body: to bee vaine-glorious, to bee ſo guidy headed, and unſetled in thy thoughts? nay (witneſſes bee

For theſe two conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then thou muſt be well pleaſed with any thing that doth happen unto thee.

And pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie it ſelfe, what more kind and amiable then it, when thou ſhalt truly conſider with thy ſelf, what it is through al the proper objects of thy rational intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall faculty curre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to go on without any fall or ſtumble? As for the things of the world, their true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is in a manner ſo involved with obſcuritie, that unto many philoſophers, and thoſe no meane ones, they ſeemed altogether incomprehenſible: and the Stoicks themſelves, though they judge them not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together incomprehenſible, yet ſcarce &amp; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty, comprehenſible, ſo that all aſſent of ours is fallible, for who is he that is infallible <hi>[in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſions?]</hi> From the nature of things, paſſe now unto their ſubjects and matter: how temporary, how

            <p n="12">XII. What thoſe things are in themſelves, which by the greateſt part are eſteemed good, thou maiſt gather even from this. For if a man ſhall heare things mentioned as good, which are really good indeed, ſuch as are prudence, temperance, juſtice, fortitude; after ſo much heard and conceived, hee cannot endure to heare of any more, for the word <hi>good</hi> is properly ſpoken of them. But as for thoſe which by the vulgar are eſteemed good, if he ſhall heare them mentioned as good, he doth hearken for more. He is well contented to heare, that what is ſpoken by the Comaedian, is but familiarly and popularly ſpoken, ſo that even the vulgar apprehend the difference. For why is it elſe, that this offends not and needs not to be excuſed, <hi>[when vertues are ſtiled good:]</hi> but that which is ſpoken in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of wealth, pleaſure, or honour, wee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it only as merrily and pleaſantly ſpoken?

            <p n="13">XIII. All that I conſiſt of, is either forme or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. No corruption can reduce either of theſe unto nothing: for neither did I of nothing become a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent creature. Every part of mine then, will by

Neither would hee

Society therefore is the proper good of a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall creature. For that we are made for ſociety, it hath long ſince beene demonſtrated. Or can any man make any queſtion of this, that whatſoever is naturally worſe and inferiour, is ordinarily ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinated to that which is better? and that thoſe things that are beſt, are made one for another?

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:414:65"/>without much difficultie be effected; but whatſoever in generall thou canſt conceive poſſible and proper unto any man, thinke that very poſſible unto thee alſo.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. Suppoſe that at the <hi>Palaeſtra</hi> ſome body hath all to torne thee with his nailes, and hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thy head. Well, thou art wounded. Yet thou doſt not exclame; thou art not offended with him. Thou doſt not ſuſpect him for it afterwards, as one that watcheth to doe thee a miſchiefe. Yea even then, though thou doſt thy beſt to ſave thy ſelfe from him, yet not from him as an enemy. It is not by way of any ſuſpitious indignation, but by way of gentle and friendly declination. Keepe the ſame mind and diſpoſition in other parts of thy life alſo. For many things there be, which wee muſt conceit and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, as though wee had had to doe with an antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt at the <hi>Palaeſtra.</hi> For as I ſaid, it is very poſſible for us to avoid and decline, though we neyther ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, nor hate.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. If any body ſhall reprove me, and ſhall make it apparant unto me, that in any either opinion or action of mine I doe erre, I will moſt gladly retract. For it is the truth that I ſeeke after, by which I am ſure that never any man was hurt; and as ſure, that he is hurt that continueth in any error, or ignorance whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. I for my part will doe what belongs unto mee; as for other things, whether things unſenſible or things irrationall; or if rationall, yet deceived and ignorant of the true way, they ſhall not trouble or diſtract mee. For as for thoſe creatures which are
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:414:65"/>not indued with reaſon, and all other things and matters of the world whatſoever, I freely, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, as one endued with reaſon, of things that have none, make uſe of them. And as for men, towards them as naturally partakers of the ſame reaſon, my care is to carry my ſelfe ſociably. But whatſoever it is that thou art about, remember to call upon the Gods. And as for the time how long thou ſhalt live to do theſe things, let it be altogether indifferent unto thee, for even three ſuch howers are ſufficient.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. <hi>Alexander</hi> of Macedon, and he that dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his mules when once dead, both came to one. For either they were both reſumed into thoſe ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall rationall eſſences from whence all things in the world are propagated; or both after one faſhion were ſcattered into Atomes.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. Conſider how many different things,<note place="margin">See B. IV Num. XXXIII</note> whether they concerne our bodies, or our ſoules, in a moment of time come to paſſe in every one of us, and ſo thou wilt not wonder if many more things or rather all things that are done, can at one time ſubſiſt, and coexiſt in that both <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Generall,</hi> which wee call the <hi>World.</hi>

            <p n="24">XXIV. If any ſhould put this queſtion unto thee, how this word <hi>Antoninus</hi> is written, wouldeſt thou not preſently fixe thine intention upon it, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out in order every letter of it?

Here then likewiſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:414:66"/>remember, that every duty that belongs unto a man doth conſiſt of ſome certaine letters or numbers as it were, to which without any noiſe or tumult kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thy ſelfe, thou muſt orderly proceed to thy propoſed end, forbearing to quarrell with him that would quarrell and fall out with thee.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. Is it not a cruell thing to forbid men to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thoſe things, which they conceive to agree beſt with their owne natures, and to tend moſt to their owne proper good and behoofe? But thou after a ſort denieſt them this libertie, as often as thou art angry with them for their ſinnes. For ſurely it is with an opinion of their owne proper good and commoditie, that they are lead unto ſuch things. But it is not ſo, thou therefore teach them better, and make it appeare unto them: but be not thou angry with them.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. Death is a ceſſation from the impreſſions of the ſenſes, the tyranny of the paſſions, the errors of the minde, and the ſervitude of the body.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. If in this kinde of life thy body be able to hold out, it is a ſhame that thy ſoule ſhould faint firſt, and give over. Take heed, leſt <hi>[of a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher]</hi> thou become a <hi>[meere]</hi> Caeſar in time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a new tincture <hi>[from the Court.]</hi> For it may happen <hi>[if thou doſt not take heed.]</hi> Keepe thy ſelfe therefore, truly ſimple, good, ſincere, grave, free from all oſtentation, a lover of that which is juſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, kinde, tender hearted, ſtrong and vigorous to undergoe any thing that becomes thee. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to continue ſuch, as philoſophie <hi>[hadſt thou wholly and conſtantly applyed thy ſelfe unto it]</hi> would

            <p n="28">XXVIII. Doe all things as becommeth the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Antoninus <hi>[Pius.]</hi> Remember his reſolute conſtancie in things that were done by him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reaſon, his equabilitie in all things, his ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; the cheerefulneſſe of his countenance, his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and how free hee was from all vaine glory; how carefull to come to the true and exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of matters in hand, and how hee would by no meanes give over till he did fully, and plainely underſtand the whole ſtate of the buſineſſe, &amp; how patiently, and without any conteſtation he would beare with them, that did unjuſtly condemne him: how he would never be overhaſty in any thing, nor give eare to ſlanders and falſe accuſations, but exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and obſerve with beſt diligence the ſeverall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and diſpoſitions of men. Againe, how hee was no backbiter, nor eaſily frighted, nor ſuſpicious, and in his language free from all affectation and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity: and how eaſily hee would content himſelfe with few things, as lodging, bedding, cloathing, and ordinarie nouriſhment, and attendance. How able to endure labour, how patient; able through his ſpare dyet to continue from morning to evening without any neceſſity of withdrawing before his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed howers to the neceſſities of nature: his uniformity and conſtancie in matter of friendſhip. How he would beare with them that with all bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and libertie oppoſed his opinions; and even

            <p n="29">XXIX. Stirre up thy minde, and recall thy wits againe <hi>[from thy naturall dreames, and viſions:]</hi> and when thou art perfectly awaken, and canſt perceive that they were but dreames that troubled thee, as one newly awakened <hi>[out of another kinde of ſleepe]</hi> looke upon theſe worldly things with the ſame minde as thou didſt upon thoſe, <hi>[that thou ſaweſt in thy ſleepe.]</hi>

            <p n="30">XXX. I conſiſt of body and ſoule, unto my body all things are indifferent, for of it ſelfe it cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one thing more then another with apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; as for my mind, all things which are not within the verge of her owne operation, are indifferent unto her, and for her owne operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thoſe altogether depend of her; neither doth ſhee buſie her ſelfe about any, but thoſe that are preſent; for as for future and paſſed operation, thoſe alſo are now at this preſent indifferent unto her.</p>
            <p n="31">XXXI. As long as the foot doth that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto it to doe, and the hand that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto it, their labour, whatſoever it bee, is not unnaturall. So a man as long as he doth that which is proper unto a man, his labour cannot be againſt nature; and if it be not againſt nature, then neither is it hurtfull unto him. <hi>[But if it were ſo that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe did conſiſt in pleaſure:]</hi> how came notorious rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,

            <p n="32">XXXII. Doeſt thou not ſee, how even thoſe that profeſſe mechanique arts, though in ſome reſpect they be no better then meere Idiots, yet they ſtick cloſe to the courſe of their trade, neither can they finde in their heart to decline from it, and is it not a grievous thing that an architect, or a phyſitian ſhall reſpect the courſe and myſteries of their profeſſion, more then a man the proper: courſe and condition of his owne nature, Reaſon, to which the gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are bound?</p>
            <p n="33">XXXIII. Aſia, Europe; what are they, but as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the whole world; of which the whole Sea, is but as one drop; &amp; the great mount Athos, but as a clodde, as all preſent time is but as one point of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. All, petty things, all things that are ſoone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, ſoone periſhed. And all things come from one beginning; either all ſeverally and particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated and reſolved upon,<note place="margin">See B. VII. N.

So that the dreadfull <hi>hiatus</hi> of a gaping Lion, and all poyſon, and all hurtfull things, are but (as the thorn and the myre) the neceſſary conſequences of goodly faire things. Think not of theſe therefore, as things contrary to thoſe which thou doeſt much honour, and reſpect; but conſider in thy minde the true fountaine of all.</p>
            <p n="34">XXXIV. Hee that ſeeth the things that are now, hath ſeene all that either was ever, or ever ſhall be, for all things are of one kinde; and all like one unto
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:414:68"/>another. Meditate often upon the connexion of all things in the world; and upon the mutuall relation that they have one unto another. For all things are after a ſort folded and involved one within another, and by theſe meanes all agree well together. For one thing is conſequent unto another, by locall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by naturall conſpiration and agreement, and by ſubſtantiall union, [or, <hi>reduction of all ſubſtances into One.</hi>]</p>
            <p n="35">XXXV. Fit and accommodate thy ſelfe to that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and to thoſe occurrences, which by the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have beene annexed unto thee; and love thoſe men whom thy fate it is to live with; but love them truly. An inſtrument, a toole, an utenſile, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, if it be fit for the purpoſe it was made for it is as it ſhould be, though he perchance that made and fitted it, be out of ſight and gone. But in things naturall, that power which hath framed and fitted them, is and abideth within them ſtill: for which reaſon ſhee ought alſo the more to be reſpected, and wee are more obliged (if wee may live and paſſe our time according to her purpoſe and intention) to thinke that all is well with us, and according to our owne mindes. After this manner alſo, and in this reſpect it is, that He that is all in all doth enjoy his happineſſe.</p>
            <p n="36">XXXVI. What things ſoever are not within the proper power and juriſdiction of thine owne will <hi>[either to compaſſe or avoid,]</hi> if thou ſhalt propoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy ſelfe any of thoſe things as either good, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; it muſt needs be that according as thou ſhalt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall into that which thou doeſt thinke evill, or

And indeed we muſt needs commit many evills, if wee incline to any of theſe things, more or leſſe, with an opinion of any difference. But if we minde and phancie thoſe things only, as good and bad, which wholly depend of our owne wills, there is no more occaſion why we ſhould either murmur againſt the gods, or be at enmitie with any man.</p>
            <p n="37">XXXVII. Wee all worke to one effect, ſome wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and with a rationall apprehenſion of what we doe: others without any ſuch knowledge. As I thinke Heraclytus in a place ſpeaketh of them that ſleepe, that even they doe worke in their kinde, and doe conferre to the generall operations of the World. One man therefore doth cooperate after one ſort, and another after another ſort; but even he that doth murmur, and to his power doth reſiſt and hinder; even he as much as any <hi>[doth cooperate.]</hi> For of ſuch alſo did the World ſtand in need. Now doe thou conſider among which of theſe thou wilt ranke thy ſelfe. For as for him who is the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator of all,<note place="margin">See B. VIII N.

But be not thou <hi>[for ſhame]</hi> ſuch a part of the whole, as that<note n="*" place="margin">See the Notes.</note> vile and ridiculous verſe (which Chryſippus
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:414:69"/>in a place doth mention) is a part of the Comaedy.</p>
            <p n="36">XXXVIII.

            <p n="39">XXXIX. If ſo be that the gods have deliberated in particular of thoſe things that ſhould happen unto me, I muſt ſtand to their deliberation, as diſcreet &amp; wiſe. For, that a god ſhould be an imprudent god, is a thing hard even to conceive: and why ſhould they reſolve to do me hurt? for what profit either unto them or the univerſe (which they ſpecially take care for) could ariſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it? But, if ſo be that they have not deliberated of me in particular, certainly they have of the whole in generall, and thoſe things which in conſequence and coherence of this generall delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration happen unto me in particular, I am bound to embrace &amp; accept of. But if ſo be that they have not deliberated at all (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> indeed is very irreligious for any man to beleeve: forthen let us neither ſacrifice, nor pray, nor reſpect our oaths, neither let us any more uſe any of thoſe things, which we perſwaded of the preſence and <hi>[ſecret]</hi> converſation of the gods among us, daily uſe and practiſe:) but, I ſay, if ſo bee that they have not indeed <hi>[either in generall, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular]</hi> deliberated of any of thoſe things, that happen unto us in this world, yet <hi>[God be thanked, that]</hi> of thoſe things that concerne my ſelfe, it is lawfull for me to deliberate my ſelfe, &amp; all my deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is but

Now, that unto every one, is moſt profitable, which is according to his owne conſtitution and Nature. And my Nature is, to be rationall <hi>[in all my actions]</hi> and as a good, and naturall member of a citty and common wealth, towards my fellow members ever to be ſociably and kindly diſpoſed and affected. My City and Country, as I am Antoninus, is Rome; as a man, the whole world. Thoſe things therefore that are expedient and profitable to thoſe Cities, are the onely things that are good &amp; expedient for me.</p>
            <p n="40">XL. Whatſoever in any kind doth happen to any one, is expedient to the whole. And thus much <hi>[to content us]</hi> might ſuffice, <hi>[that it is expedient for the whole in generall.]</hi> But yet this alſo ſhalt thou gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally perceive, if thou doſt diligently take heed, that whatſoever <hi>[doth happen]</hi> to any one man or men ❀❀❀❀. And now I am content that the word <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> ſhould more generally be underſtood of <hi>thoſe things which wee otherwiſe call]</hi> middle things, [or, <hi>things indifferent; as health, wealth, and the like.</hi>]</p>
            <p n="41">XLI. As the ordinary ſhewes of the Theatre and of other ſuch places, when thou art preſented with them [<hi>affect thee;</hi> as the ſame things ſtill ſeene, and in the ſame faſhion, make the ſight ingratefull and tedious; ſo muſt all the things that wee ſee all our life long affect us. For all things, above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, are ſtill the ſame, and from the ſame <hi>[cauſes.]</hi> When then will there be an end?</p>
            <p n="42">XLII. Let the ſeverall deaths of men of all ſorts, and of all ſorts of profeſſions, and of all ſort of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, be a perpetuall object of thy thoughts, ❀❀❀❀ ſo that thou mayſt even come downe to Phileſtio,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:414:70"/>Phoebus, and Origanius. Paſſe now to other genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thither ſhall wee after many changes, where ſo many brave Oratours are; where ſo many grave Philoſophers; Heraclytus, Pythagoras, Socrates. Where ſo many <hi>Heroes</hi> of the old times; and then ſo many brave captaines of the latter times; and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kings. After all theſe, where Eudoxus, Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Archimedes; where ſo many other ſharpe, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, induſtrious, ſubtile, peremptory diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and among others, even they, that have beene the greateſt ſcoffers and deriders of the frailty and brevity of this our humane life; as Menippus, and others, as many as there have beene ſuch as hee. Of all theſe conſider, that they long ſince are all dead, and gone. And what doe they ſuffer by it! Nay they that have not ſo much as a Name remaining, what are they the worſe for it? One thing there is, and that onely, which is worth our while in this <hi>World,</hi> and ought by us much to be eſteemed; and that is, according to truth and righteouſneſſe, meekely and lovingly to converſe with falſe, &amp; unrighteous men.</p>
            <p n="43">XLIII. When thou wilt comfort and cheare thy ſelfe, call to mind the ſeverall gifts and vertues of them, whom thou doſt daily converſe with; as for example, the induſtrie of the one; the modeſtie of another; the liberalitie of a third; of another ſome other thing. For nothing can ſo much rejoyce thee, as the reſemblances and parallels of ſeverall vertues, viſible and eminent in the diſpoſitions of thoſe who live with thee; eſpecially when unto thee many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether doe repreſent themſelves: as many as thy mind is well capable of at once. And therefore thou

            <p n="44">XLIV. Doſt thou grieve that thou doſt weigh but ſo many pounds, and not 300 rather?

Let us doe our beſt endevours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them; but however, if Reaſon and Juſtice lead thee to it, doe it, though they be never ſo much againſt it.

            <p n="17">XVII.

            <p n="18">XVIII. An angry countenance is much againſt nature, and it is oftentimes the proper countenance

For this when thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, thou wilt pitty him thou wilt have no occaſion either to wonder, or to be angry. For either thou thy ſelfe doeſt yet <hi>[live in that error and ignorance, as that thou doeſt]</hi> ſuppoſe either that very thing that he doth, or ſome other like <hi>[wordly]</hi> thing, to bee good: and ſo thou art bound to pardon him <hi>[if hee have done that which thou in the like caſe wouldeſt have done thy ſelfe.]</hi> Or if ſo be that thou doeſt not any more ſuppoſe the ſame things to be good or evill,

For thus in very truth, ſtands the caſe, O yee men of Athens. What place or ſtation ſoever a man either hath choſen to himſelfe, judging it beſt for himſelfe; or is by lawfull authoritie put &amp; ſetled in, therein doe I thinke (all appearance of danger notwithſtanding:) that hee ſhould continue as one who feareth neither death, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe ſo much as he feareth to commmit any thing that is vicious and ſhamefull, &amp;c.

That which the Nature of the Univerſe doth buſie her ſelfe about, is; that which is here, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it thither, to change it, and thence againe to take it away, and to carry it to another place.

And laſtly, when it willingly and gladly embraceth, whatſoever is dealt and appointed unto it by the common Nature.

But never did any honeſt vertuous man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the neglect or omiſſion of any <hi>[carnall]</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: no <hi>[carnall]</hi> pleaſure then is either good or proſitable.</p>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:414:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>him with inſtincts and opportunities <hi>[ſufficient for the attainement of it:]</hi> which he having hitherto neglected, is not now able to diſcerne that which is falſe from that which is true. Hee alſo that purſues after pleaſures, as that which is truely good;<note place="margin">See Note 5. upon B. II.</note> and flies from paines, as that which is truely evill, is impious. For ſuch a one muſt of neceſſity oftentimes accuſe that common Nature, as diſtributing many things both unto the evill, &amp; unto the good, not according to the deſerts of either: as unto the bad oftentimes pleaſures, and the cauſes of pleaſures; So unto the good, paines, and the occaſions of paines. Againe, he that feareth paines and croſſes in the world, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſome of thoſe things which ſometime or other muſt needes happen in the world. And that wee have already ſhewed to be impious. And hee that purſueth after pleaſures, will not ſpare, <hi>[to compaſſe his deſires]</hi> to doe that which is unjuſt, and that is manifeſtly impious. Now thoſe things which unto Nature are equally indifferent (for ſhe had not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both, both paine and pleaſure, if both had not beene unto her equally indifferent:) they that will live according to Nature, muſt in thoſe things (as being of the ſame minde and diſpoſition that ſhee is) be as equally indifferent. Whoſoever therefore in either matter of pleaſure and paine; death, and life; honour and diſhonour, (which things Nature in the adminiſtration of the world, indifferently doth make uſe of,) is not as indifferent, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that hee is impious. When I ſay that common Nature doth indifferently make uſe of them, my meaning is, that in the ordinary courſe of things,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:414:94"/>which by a neceſſary conſequence (according to that firſt and ancient deliberation of Providence, by which ſhee from ſome certaine beginning, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon the creation of ſuch a World, conceiving then in her wombe as it were ſome certaine <hi>rational</hi> generative ſeedes &amp; faculties of things future, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubjects, changes, ſucceſſions; both ſuch and ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and juſt ſo many:) whether as principall or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſorie come to paſſe in the world, they happen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It were indeed more happy and comfortable, for a man to depart out of this World, having lived all his life long cleare from all falſhood, diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, voluptuouſneſſe, and pride. But if this cannot be, yet is it ſome comfort for a man <hi>[joyfully]</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part <hi>[as]</hi> weary, and out of love with thoſe; rather then to deſire to live, and to continue long in theſe wicked courſes. Hath not yet experience taught thee to flye from the plague? For a farre greater plague is the corruption of the minde, then any certaine change and diſtemper of the common aire can be. This is a plague of creatures, as they are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures; but that of men as they are men [or <hi>reaſonable.</hi>]</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thou muſt not in matter of death, carry thy ſelfe ſcornfully, but as one that is well pleaſed with it, as being one of thoſe things that Nature hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. For what thou doſt conceive of theſe, of a <hi>boy to become a young man, to waxe old, to grow, to ripen, to get teeth, or a beard, or gray haires; to beget, to beare, or to be delivered;</hi> or what other action ſoever it be, that is naturall unto man according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:414:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſeaſons of his life; ſuch a thing is it alſo <hi>to be diſſolved.</hi> It is therefore the part of a wiſe man, in matter of death,<note place="margin">See note upon B. XI N. 3.</note> not in any wiſe to carry himſelfe either violently, or proudly; but patiently to wayte for it, as one of Natures operations: that with the ſame minde as now thou doeſt expect when that which yet is but an <hi>Embryo</hi> in thy Wifes belly ſhall come forth; thou mayſt expect alſo when thy ſoule ſhall fall off from that <hi>[outward coat or skinne:]</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>[as a childe in the belly]</hi> it lieth involved and ſhut up. But if thou deſireſt a more popular, and though not ſo direct and philoſophicall, yet a very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and penetratiue receipt againſt the feare of death, Nothing can make thee more willing to part with thy life, then if thou ſhalt conſider, both what the ſubjects the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves are that thou ſhalt part with, and what manner of diſpoſitions thou ſhalt no more haue to doe with. True it is, that offended with them thou muſt not be by no meanes, but take care of them, and meekely beare with them. However, this thou mayeſt remember, that whenſoever it happens that thou depart, it ſhall not be from men that held the ſame opinions that thou doeſt. For that indeede, (if it were ſo) is the onely thing that might make thee averſe from death, and willing to continue here, if it were thy hap to live with men that had obtained the ſame beliefe that thou haſt. But now, what a toyle it is for thee to live with men of different opinions, thou ſeeſt: ſo that thou haſt rather occaſion to ſay, <hi>Haſten, I thee pray, O Death; leaſt I alſo in time forget my ſelfe.</hi>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:414:95"/>that is unjuſt, hurts himſelfe, in that he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe worſe then he was before. Not he onely that committeth, but he alſo that omitteth ſome thing, is oftentimes unjuſt.</p>

            <p n="7">VII. Of all unreaſonable creatures, there is but one unreaſonable ſoule; and of all that are reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but one reaſonable Soule, divided betwixt them all. As of all earthly things there is but one Earth; and but one light that we ſee by; and but one ayre that we breath in, as many as either breath or ſee. Now whatſoever partakes of ſome common thing, naturally affects &amp; enclines unto that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is part, being of one kinde and nature with it. Whatſoever is Earthly, preſſeth downwards to the common Earth. Whatſoever is liquid, would flow together. And whatſoever is ayrie, would be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likewiſe. So that without ſome obſtacle, and ſome kinde of violence, they cannot well be kept aſunder. Whatſoever is fiery, doth not onely by reaſon of the Elementarie fire tend upwards; but here alſo is ſo ready to joyne, and to burne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that whatſoever doth want ſufficient moiſture to make reſiſtance, is eaſily ſet on fire. Whatſoever therefore is partaker of that reaſonable common
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:414:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>Nature, <hi>[naturally]</hi> doth as much and more long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his owne kinde. For by how much in its owne nature it excells all other things, by ſo much more is it deſirous to be joyned and united unto that, which is of its owne nature. As for unreaſonable creatures then, they had not long beene, but preſently begun among them ſwarmes, and flocks, and broods of young ones, and a kinde of mutuall love and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For <hi>[though but unreaſonable, yet]</hi> a <hi>[kinde of]</hi> ſoule theſe had, and therefore was that naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of union more ſtrong and intenſe in them, as in creatures of a more excellent nature, then either in plants, or ſtones, or trees. But among reaſonable creatures, begunne common-wealths, friendſhips, families, publick meetings, and even in their warres conventions and truces. Now among them that were yet of a more excellent nature, as the ſtarres and planets, though by their nature farre diſtant one from another, yet even among them beganne ſome mutuall correſpondencie and unitie. So proper is it to excellencie in a high degree to affect unitie, as that even in things ſo farre diſtant, it could operate unto a mutuall Sympathie. But now behold, what is now come to paſſe. Thoſe creatures that are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, are now the only creatures that have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten their naturall affection &amp; inclination of one towards another. Among them alone <hi>[of all other things that are of one kinde]</hi> there is not to be found, a <hi>generall diſpoſition to flow together.</hi> But though they fly from Nature, yet are they ſtopt in their courſe, and apprehended. Doe they what they can, Nature doth prevaile. And ſo ſhalt thou confeſſe, if thou
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:414:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>doeſt obſerve it. For ſooner mayeſt thou finde a thing earthly, where no earthly thing is, then finde a man that <hi>[naturally]</hi> can live by himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Man, God, the World, every one in their kinde, beare ſome fruits. All things have their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time <hi>to beare.</hi> Though by cuſtome, the word it ſelfe is in a manner become proper unto the vine, and the like, yet is it ſo nevertheleſſe, as wee have ſaid. As for reaſon, that beareth both common fruit for the uſe of others; and peculiar, which it ſelfe doth enjoy. Reaſon is of a diffuſive nature, what it ſelfe is in it ſelfe, it begets in others, and ſo doth multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Either teach them better if it be in thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; or if it be not, remember that for this uſe <hi>[to beare with them patiently]</hi> was mildneſſe and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe granted unto thee. The gods themſelves are good unto ſuch; yea and in ſome things, (as in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of health, of wealth, of honour,) are content of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to further their endeavours: ſo good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are thy. And mighteſt thou not be ſo too? or, tell me, what doth hinder thee?</p>
            <p n="10">X. Labour not as one <hi>[to whom it is appointed to be]</hi> wretched, nor as one that either would be pittied, or admired; but let this be thine only care &amp; deſire, ſo alwayes and in all things to proſecute or to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, as the law of Charity [or, <hi>mutuall ſociety</hi>] doth require.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. This day <hi>I did come out</hi> of all my trouble. Nay I <hi>have caſt out</hi> all my trouble; it ſhould rather be. For that which troubled thee, whatſoever it was, was

            <p n="12">XII. All thoſe things, for matter of experience are uſuall and ordinarie; for their continuance but for a day; and for their matter, moſt baſe, and filthy. As they were in the dayes of thoſe whom we have buried, ſo are they now alſo, and no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. The things themſelves <hi>[that affect us]</hi> they ſtand without doores, neither knowing any thing themſelves nor able to utter any thing unto others concerning themſelves. What then is it, that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth verdict on them? The underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. As vertue and wickedneſſe conſiſt not in paſſion, but in action; ſo neither doth the true good or evill of a reaſonable charitable man conſiſt in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but in operation and action.</p>

            <p n="17">XVII. All things that are in the world, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the eſtate of alteration. Thou alſo art in a perpetuall change, yea and under corruption too, in ſome part: and ſo is the whole world.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. It is <hi>[not thine, but]</hi> another mans ſinne. <hi>[Why ſhould it trouble thee?]</hi> Let him looke to it, whoſe ſinne it is.</p>

In all this there is no hurt. Apply this now to a mans age, as firſt, a child; then a youth, then a young man, then an old man; every change from one age to another is a kinde of death. And all this while here is no matter of griefe yet. Paſſe now unto that life, firſt, that which thou livedſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy Grandfather, then under thy Mother, then under thy Father. And thus when through the whole courſe of thy life hitherto thou haſt found and obſerved many alterations, many changes, many kindes of <hi>endings</hi> and ceſſations, put this queſtion to thy ſelfe, what matter of griefe or ſorrow doſt thou finde in any of theſe?

            <p n="42">XLII. It is common to all trades and profeſſions to minde and intend that only, which now they are about, and the inſtrument whereby they worke.</p>
            <p n="43">XLIII. When at any time thou art offended with any ones impudencie, put preſently this queſtion to thy ſelfe; What? Is it then poſſible, that there ſhould not be any impudent men in the world! Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is not poſſible. Deſire not then that which is impoſſible. For this one, (thou muſt thinke) who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he be, is one of thoſe impudent ones, that the world cannot be without. So of the ſubtle and craftie, ſo of the perfidious, ſo of every one that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth, muſt thou ever bee ready to reaſon with thy ſelfe. For whileſt in generall thou doeſt thus reaſon with thy ſelfe, that the kinde of them muſt needs be in the world, thou wilt be the better able to uſe meekneſſe towards every particular. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thou ſhalt find of very good uſe, upon every ſuch occaſion, preſently to conſider with thy ſelfe, what proper vertue nature hath furniſhed man with, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a vice, [or, <hi>to encounter with a diſpoſition vicious in this kinde.</hi>] As for example, againſt the unthankfull, it hath given goodneſſe and meekneſſe, as an antidote, and ſo againſt another <hi>[vicious in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kinde]</hi> ſome other peculiar facultie. And generally, is it not in thy power to inſtruct him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is in an error? For whoſoever ſinneth, doth in that decline from his purpoſed end, and is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deceived. And againe, what art thou the worſe for his ſinne? For thou ſhalt not finde that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:414:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>any one of theſe, againſt whom thou art incenſed, hath in very deed done any thing whereby thy minde (the only true ſubject of thy hurt and evill:) can be made worſe, then it was. And what a matter of either griefe or wonder is this, if he that is <hi>unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> doe the deeds of one that is <hi>unlearned?</hi> Should not thou rather blame thy ſelf, who, when upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very good grounds of reaſon, thou mightſt have thought it very probable, that ſuch a thing would by ſuch a one be committed, didſt not onely not foreſee it, but moreover doeſt wonder at it, that ſuch a thing ſhould be. But then eſpecially, when thou doeſt finde fault with either an unthankfull, or a falſe man, muſt thou reflect upon thy ſelfe. For without all queſtion, thou thy ſelfe art much in fault, if either of one that were of ſuch a diſpoſition thou didſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that he ſhould be true unto thee: or when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any thou didſt a good turne, thou didſt not there bound thy thoughts, as one that had obtained his end; nor didſt not thinke that from the action it ſelfe thou hadſt received a full reward of the good that thou hadſt done. For what wouldſt thou have more? Unto him that is a man, thou haſt done a good turne: doth not that ſuffice thee? What thy nature required, that haſt thou done. Muſt thou be rewarded for it? As if either the eye for that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or the feet for that they goe, ſhould require ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. For as theſe being by nature appointed for ſuch an uſe, can challenge no more, then that they may worke according to their naturall conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: ſo man being borne to do good unto others whenſoever he doth a reall good unto any <hi>[by hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

Thou ſhalt one day be full, and in want of no externall thing: not ſeeking pleaſure from any thing, either living or unſenſible, that this World can afford; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanting time for the continuation of thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor place and oportunitie, nor the favour ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the weather or of men.

Such one day ſhall be thy diſpoſition, that thou ſhalt be able, both in regard of the gods, and in regard of men, ſo to fit and order thy converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as neither to complaine of them at any time, for any thing that they doe; nor to doe any thing thy ſelfe, for which thou mayeſt <hi>[juſtly]</hi> be condemned.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As one who is altogether governed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, let it be thy care to obſerve what it is that thy nature <hi>[in generall]</hi> doth require. That done, if thou finde not that thy nature, as thou art a living ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature, will be the worſe for it, thou mayeſt proceed.

            <p n="3">III. Whatſoever doth happen unto thee, thou art naturally by thy naturall conſtitution either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or not able to beare.

            <p n="6">VI. Either <hi>[with Epicurus, we muſt fondly imagine]</hi> the atomes <hi>[to be the cauſe of all things]</hi> or <hi>[wee muſt needs grant]</hi> a Nature. Let this then bee thy firſt ground, that thou art part of that Univerſe, which is governed by nature. Then ſecondly, that to thoſe parts that are of the ſame kinde and Nature as thou art, thou haſt relation of kindred. For of theſe, if I ſhall alwayes be mindfull, firſt as I am a part, I ſhall never be diſpleaſed with any thing, that falls to my particular ſhare of the common chances of the world. For nothing that is behoovefull unto the whole, can be <hi>[truly]</hi> hurtfull to that which is part of it. For this being the common priviledge of all natures, that they containe nothing in themſelves that is hurtfull unto them; it cannot be that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Univerſe (whoſe priviledge beyond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular natures, is, that ſhee cannot againſt

As then I beare in minde that I am a part of ſuch an Univerſe, I ſhall not be diſpleaſed with any thing that happens. And as I have relation of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to thoſe parts that are of the ſame kinde and nature that I am, ſo I ſhall bee carefull to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is prejudiciall to the communitie, but in all my deliberations ſhall my Kinde ever be; and the common good, that, which all my intentions and reſolutions ſhall drive unto, as that which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto it, I ſhall by all meanes endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and avoid.

            <p n="7">VII. All parts of the world, (all things I meane that are contained within the whole world,) muſt of neceſſitie at ſome time or other come to <hi>corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Now ſay I, if ſo bee that this bee both hurtfull unto them, and yet unavoidable, would not, thinkeſt thou, the whole it ſelfe bee in a ſweet caſe, all the parts of it being ſubject to alteration, yea and by their making it ſelfe fitted for corruption, as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of things different and contrarie? And did na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:414:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>then either of her ſelfe thus project and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the affliction and miſerie of her parts, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of purpoſe ſo made them, not only that haply they might, but of neceſſity that they ſhould fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to evill; or did not ſhee know what ſhee did, when ſhee made them? For either of theſe two to ſay, is equally abſurd. But to let paſſe nature in generall, and to reaſon of things particular according to their owne particular natures; how abſurd and ridiculous is it, firſt to ſay that all parts of the whole are, by their proper naturall conſtitution ſubject to altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then when any ſuch thing doth happen <hi>[as when one doth fall ſick and dyeth]</hi> to take on and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as though ſome ſtrange thing had happened?

Elſe muſt hee of neceſſitie, whoſoever hee bee that meets with any of them, become worſe then he was before. For ſo is it in all other ſubjects, that that is thought hurtfull unto them, wherby they are made worſe. But here contrariwiſe, man (if he make that good uſe of them that he ſhould) is rather the better and the more praiſe worthy for any of thoſe kinde of hinderances, then otherwiſe. But generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that nothing can hurt a naturall Citizen, that is not hurtfull unto the Citie it ſelfe, nor any thing hurt the City, that is not hurtfull unto the Law it ſelfe. But none of theſe caſualties, or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hinderances, doe <hi>hurt the Law it ſelfe;</hi> [or, <hi>are contrarie to that courſe of Iuſtice, and equitie, by which publick ſocieties are maintained:</hi>] neither therefore doe they hurt either Citie or Citizen.</p>

            <p n="35">XXXV. A good eye muſt be good to ſee whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is to be ſeene, and not greene things only. For that is proper to ſore eyes. So muſt a good eare, and a good ſmell be ready for whatſoever is either to be heard, or ſmelt: and a good ſtomach as indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to all kindes of food, as a milſtone, to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhee was made for, to grinde.

There is not any man that is ſo happy in his death, but that ſome of thoſe that are by him when he dies, will be ready to rejoyce at his <hi>[ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed]</hi> calamitie. Is it one that was vertuous and wiſe indeed? Will there not ſome one or other be found, who thus will ſay to himſelfe, <hi>Well now at laſt ſhall I bee at reſt from this Pedagogue.

But as for us, alas! how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things be there, for which there bee many that glad would be to be rid of us. This therefore if thou ſhalt thinke of whenſoever thou dyeſt, thou ſhalt die the more willingly, when thou ſhalt thinke with thy ſelfe, I am now to depart from that world, wherein thoſe that have beene my neereſt friends and acquaintances, they whom I have ſo much ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for, ſo often prayed for, and for whom I have taken ſuch care; even they would have me die, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that after my death they ſhall live happier, then they did before. What then ſhould any man deſire to continue here any longer? Nevertheleſſe, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou dyeſt, thou muſt not be leſſe kinde and loving unto them for it; but as before, ſee them, continue to be their friend, to wiſh them well, and meekly, and gently to cary thy ſelfe towards them, but yet ſo that on the other ſide, it make thee not the more unwilling to die.

            <p n="37">XXXVII. Uſe thy ſelfe, as often, as thou ſeeſt any man doe any thing, preſently (if it bee poſſible) to ſay unto thy ſelfe, what is this mans end in this his action?

From Juſtice all other vertues have their exiſtence. For Juſtice cannot be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if either wee ſettle our mindes and affections upon worldly things; or be apt to be deceived, or raſh, and inconſtant.</p>

For it is inwardly that theſe things muſt be: that the gods <hi>[who look inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not upon the outward appearance,]</hi> may behold a man truly free from all indignation and griefe.

O man, what doeſt thou meane! what needs this profeſſion of thine? the thing it ſelfe will ſhew it. It ought to be written upon thy forehead, No ſooner thy voyce is heard, then thy countenance muſt bee able to ſhew what is in thy mind: even as he that is loved knowes preſently by the lookes of his ſweet-heart what is in her minde.

But the affectation of ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, is nowiſe laudable. There is nothing more ſhamefull then perfidious friendſhip. Above all things, that muſt be avoided. <hi>[However]</hi> true good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſimplicitie and kindneſſe cannot ſo be hidden, but that <hi>[as wee have already ſaid]</hi> in the very eyes and countenance they will ſhew themſelves.</p>
            <p n="25">XV. To live happily is an inward power of the ſoule, when ſhee is affected with indifferencie [or, <hi>indifferently affected</hi>] towards thoſe things that are by their nature indifferent. To be thus affected ſhe muſt conſider all worldly objects both divided and whole: remembring withall that no object can of it ſelfe beget any opinion in us, neither can come to us, but ſtands without ſtill and quiet; but that we our ſelves beget, and as it were print in our ſelves opinions concerning them. Now it is in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not to print them; and <hi>[if they creepe in]</hi> and lurk in ſome corner, it is in our power to wipe them off. Remembring moreover, that this care and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of thine, is to continue but for a while, and then thy life will be at an end. And what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that thou mayeſt doe well with all theſe things? For if they be according to nature, rejoyce in them, and let them bee pleaſing and acceptable unto thee. But if they be againſt Nature, ſeek thou that which is according to thine owne Nature, and whether it be for thy credit or no, uſe all poſſible ſpeed <hi>[for the attainment of it:]</hi> for no man ought to be blamed, for ſeeking his owne good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</p>

Of every thing <hi>[thou muſt conſider]</hi> from whence it came, of what things it doth conſiſt, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what it wil be changed: what wil be the nature of it [or, <hi>what it will be like unto</hi>] when it is changed; and that it can ſuffer no hurt by this change. <hi>[And as for other mens, either fooliſhneſſe, or wickedneſſe, that it may not trouble and grieve thee;]</hi> Firſt generally thus; What reference have I unto theſe? and that we are all borne for one anothers good: Then <hi>[more particularly]</hi> after another conſideration; as a Ram is firſt in a flock of Sheepe, and a Bull in a Heard of cattell, ſo am I borne to rule over them. Begin yet higher, even from this: if <hi>Atomes</hi> be not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all things <hi>[then which to beleeve nothing can be more abſurd]</hi> then muſt wee needes grant that there is a Nature, that doth governe the Univerſe.

Secondly, what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of men they be, at board, and upon their beds, and ſo forth. But above all things, how they are forced by their opinions that they hold, to doe what they doe; and even thoſe things that they doe, with what pride and ſelfe-conceit they doe them. Thirdly, that if they doe theſe things rightly, thou haſt no reaſon to be grieved. But if not rightly, it muſt needes be that they doe them againſt their wills, and through meere igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For as <hi>[according to Platoes opinion]</hi> no ſoule doth willingly erre, ſo by conſequent neither doth it any thing otherwiſe then it ought, but againſt her will. Therefore are they grieved, whenſoever they heare themſelves charged, either of unjuſtice,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:414:118"/>or unconſcionableneſſe, or covetouſneſſe, or in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, of any injurious kinde of dealing towards their neighbours. Fourthly, that thou thy ſelfe doeſt tranſgreſſe in many things, and art even ſuch another as they are. And though perchance thou doeſt forbeare the very act of ſome ſinnes, yet haſt thou in thy ſelfe an habituall diſpoſition to them, but that either through feare, or vaine glory, or ſome ſuch other ambitious fooliſh reſpect, thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. Fiftly, that whether they have ſinned or no, thou doeſt not underſtand perfectly. For many things are done by way of diſcreet policie; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally a man muſt know many things firſt, before he be able truly and judiciouſly to judge of another mans action. Sixtly, that whenſoever thou doeſt take on grievouſly, or makeſt great woe, <hi>[little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>eſt thou remember then]</hi> that a mans life, is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time, and that within a while wee ſhall all bee in our graves. Seaventhly, That it is not the ſinnes and tranſgreſſions themſelves that trouble us properly; for they have their exiſtence in their mindes and underſtandings onely, <hi>[that commit them;]</hi> but our owne opinions concerning thoſe ſinnes. Remove then, and bee content to part with that conceit of thine, that it is a grievous thing, and thou haſt removed thine anger. But how ſhould I remove it? <hi>[How?]</hi> reaſoning with thy ſelfe that it is not ſhamefull. For if that which is ſhamefull, be not the onely true evill that is, thou alſo wilt be driven <hi>[whileſt thou doeſt follow the common inſtinct of Nature,</hi>

               <hi>to avoyde that which is evill,]</hi> to commit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unjuſt things, and to become a thiefe, and any
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:414:118"/>thing, <hi>[that will make to the attainement of thy intended worldly ends.]</hi> Eightly, How many things may and doe oftentimes follow upon ſuch fits of anger and griefe; farre more grievous in themſelves, then thoſe very things which we are ſo grieved or angry for. Ninthly, That meekeneſſe is a thing uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable, if it be true and naturall, and not affected, or hypocriticall. For how ſhall even the moſt fierce and malicious that thou ſhalt conceive, be able to hold on againſt thee, if thou ſhalt ſtill continue meeke and loving unto him; and that even at that time, when hee is about to doe thee wrong, thou ſhalt be well diſpoſed, and in good temper, with all meekeneſſe to teach him, and to inſtruct him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? As for example; <hi>My ſonne, wee were not borne for this, to hurt and annoy one another; It will be thy hurt not mine, my ſonne:</hi> and ſo to ſhew him forcibly and fully, that it is ſo in very deede: and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bees doe it one to another, nor any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are naturally ſociable. But this thou muſt doe, not ſcoffingly, nor by way of exprobration, but tenderly without any harſhneſſe of words. Neither muſt thou doe it by way of exerciſe, or oſtentation, that they that are by and heare thee, may admire thee: but ſo alwayes that no body be privie to it, but himſelfe alone: yea, though there be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the ſame time. Theſe nine particular heads, as ſo many gifts from the Muſes, ſee that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well: and begin one day, whileſt thou art yet alive, to bee a man indeede. But on the other ſide thou muſt take heede, as much to flatter them, as to be angry with them: for both are equally
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:414:119"/>uncharitable, and equally hurtfull. And in thy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, take it preſently to thy conſideration, that to be angry, is not the part of a man, but that to bee meeke and gentle, as it ſavours of more humanity, ſo of more manhood. That in this, there is ſtrength and nerves [or, <hi>vigour</hi>] and fortitude; whereof an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and indignation is altogether voyde. For the neerer every thing is unto <hi>unpaſsionatneſſe,</hi> the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer it is unto power. And as griefe doth proceede from weakeneſſe, ſo doth anger. For both <hi>[both hee that is angry &amp; that grieveth]</hi> have received a wound, and cowardly have as it were yeelded themſelves <hi>[unto their affections.]</hi> If thou wilt have a Tenth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, receive this Tenth gift from <hi>[Hercules]</hi> the Guide and Leader of the Muſes: That it is a mad mans part, to looke that there ſhould be no wicked men in the World, becauſe it is impoſſible. Now for a man to brooke well enough, that there ſhould be wicked men in the World, but not to endure that any ſhould tranſgreſſe againſt himſelfe, is againſt all equity, and indeede tyrannicall.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII Foure ſeverall diſpoſitions, [or, <hi>inclinations</hi>] there be of the minde and underſtanding, which to be aware of, thou muſt carefully obſerve: and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou doeſt diſcover them, thou muſt rectifie them, ſaying to thy ſelfe concerning every one of them, This imagination is not neceſſary; This is uncharitable: This thou ſhalt ſpeake as another mans ſlave, or inſtrument; then which nothing can be more ſenſeleſſe and abſurd: For the Fourth, thou ſhalt ſharply check and upbraid thy ſelfe, for that thou doeſt ſuffer that more divine part in thee,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:414:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>to become ſubject and obnoxious to that more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble part of thy body, and the groſſe luſts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences thereof.</p>

            <p n="13">XIII. If it be not fitting; doe it not. If it bee not true, ſpeake it not. Ever maintaine thine owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſolution free from all compulſion and neceſſitie.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. Of every thing that preſents it ſelfe unto thee, to conſider what the true nature of it is, and to unfold it, as it were, by dividing it into that which is formall: that which is materiall: the true uſe or end of it, and the juſt time that it is appointed to laſt.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. It is high time for thee, to underſtand that there is ſomewhat in thee, better and more divine then either thy paſſions, or thy ſenſual appetites and affections. What is now the object of my minde, is it feare, or ſuſpition, or luſt, or any ſuch thing? To doe nothing raſhly without ſome certaine end; let that be thy firſt care. The next, to have no other
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:414:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>end then the common good. For, alas! yet a little while, and thou art no more: no more will any, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe things that now thou ſeeſt, or of thoſe men that now are living, be any more. For all things are by nature appointed <hi>[ſoone]</hi> to be changed, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and corrupted, that other things might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their roome.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. <hi>[Remember]</hi> that all is but opinion, and all opinion depends of the minde. Take thine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on away, and then as a ſhip that hath ſtricken in within the armes and mouth of the harbour, <hi>a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent calme; all things ſafe and ſteady: a Bay, not capable of any ſtormes and tempeſts: [as the Poet hath it.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">XVII. No operation whatſoever it be, ceaſing for a while, can be truly ſaid to ſuffer any evill, becauſe it is at an end. Neither can he that is the Author of that operation; for this very reſpect, becauſe his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration is at an end, be ſaid to ſuffer any evill. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then, neither can the whole body of all our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (which is our life:) if in time it ceaſe, be ſaid to ſuffer any evill for this very reaſon, becauſe it is at an end: nor He truly be ſaid to have beene ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, that did put a period to this <hi>ſeries</hi> of actions. Now this time or certaine period, depends of the determination of Nature: ſometimes of particular nature, as when a man dyeth old; but of nature in generall, however; the parts whereof thus changing one after another, the whole world ſtill continues freſh and new. Now that is ever beſt and moſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, which is for the good of the Whole. Thus it appeares that death of it ſelfe, can neither bee hurtfull to any in particular, becauſe it is not a ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:414:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>thing (for neither is it a thing that depends of our owne will, nor of it ſelfe contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good) and generally, as it is both expedient and ſeaſonable to the Whole, that in that reſpect it muſt needs be good. It is that alſo, which is brought unto us by the order and appointment of the divine providence; ſo that hee whoſe will and minde in theſe things runnes along with the divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and by this concurrence of his will and minde with the Divine providence, is led &amp; driven along, as it were by God himſelfe, may truly be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and eſteemed the <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. Theſe three things thou muſt have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in a readineſſe: firſt concerning thine owne actions, whether thou doeſt nothing either idly, or otherwiſe, then juſtice and equity doe require: and concerning thoſe things that happen unto thee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally; that either they happen unto thee by chance, or by providence; of which two to accuſe either, is equally againſt reaſon. Secondly, what like unto our bodies are [or, <hi>what are the beginnings of our bodies</hi>] whileſt yet rude and imperfect, untill they be <hi>animated:</hi> and from their <hi>animation,</hi> untill their expiration: of what things they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and into what things they ſhall be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Thirdly, <hi>[how vaine all things will appeare unto thee]</hi> when, from on high as it were, looking down,<note place="margin">See B. VII. n. 26</note> thou ſhalt contemplate all things upon Earth, and the wonderfull murability, that they are ſubject unto: conſidering withall, both the immenſneſſe of that Ayre, and of that Heaven [or, <hi>the infinite, both
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:414:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>greatneſſe and variety of things aeriall and things coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall,</hi>] that are round about it. And that as often as thou ſhalt behold them, thou ſhalt ſtill ſee the ſame: as the ſame things, ſo the ſame ſhortneſſe of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of all thoſe things. And, behold, Theſe be the things that we are ſo proud, and puffed up for.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. Caſt away from thee opinion, and thou art ſafe. And what is it that hinders thee from caſting of it away? When thou art grieved at any thing, haſt thou forgotten that all things happen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Nature of the Univerſe; and that him onely it concernes, who is in fault; and moreover, that what is now done, is that which from ever hath beene done in the world, and will ever be done, and is now done every where: how neerely all men are allied one to another by a kindred not of blood, nor of ſeed, but of the ſame minde. Thou haſt alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that every mans minde, partakes of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and iſſueth from thence; and that no man can properly call any thing his owne, no not his ſonne, nor his body, not his life; for that they all proceed from that One <hi>[who is the giver of all things:]</hi> That all things are but opinion; that no man lives pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but that very inſtant of time which is now preſent [or, <hi>that all life properly doth conſiſt in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtant of time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See B. II. n. XII.</note> 
               <hi>ſeparated from the which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſt or future.</hi>] And therefore that no man <hi>[whenſoever hee dieth]</hi> can properly be ſaid to loſe any more, then an inſtant of time.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. Let thy thoughts ever runne upon them, who once for ſome one thing or other, were moved with extraordinary indignation; who were once in the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:414:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>higheſt pitch of either honour, or calamity; or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall hatred and enmity; or of any other fortune or condition whatſoever. Then conſider whats now become of all thoſe things. All is turned to ſmoake; all to aſhes, and a meere fable; and perchance not ſo much as a fable. As alſo whatſoever is of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as Fabius Catulinus in the field; Lucius Lupus, and Stertinius at <hi>Baiae;</hi> Tiberius at <hi>Capreae:</hi> and Velius Rufus, and all ſuch examples of vehement proſecution in worldly matters; let theſe alſo runne in thy minde at the ſame time; and how vile every object of ſuch earneſt and vehement proſecution is; and how much more agreeable to true Philoſophie it is, for a man to carry himſelfe in every matter that offers it ſelfe, juſtly, and moderatly, as one that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the Gods with all ſimplicity, For, for a man to be proud and high conceited, that he is not proud and high conceited, is of all kinde of pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, the moſt intolerable.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. To them that aske thee, Where haſt thou ſeene the Gods, or how knoweſt thou certainly that there be Gods, that thou art ſo devout in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? I anſwer firſt of all, that even to the very eye, they are in ſome manner viſible and apparent. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, neither have I ever ſeene mine owne ſoule, and yet I reſpect and honour it. So then for the Gods, by the dayly experience that I have of their power <hi>[and providence towards my ſelfe and others:]</hi> I know certainly that they are, and therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. Herein doth conſiſt happineſſe of life, for a man to know theroughly the true nature of every
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:414:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>thing; What is the matter, and what is the forme of it: with all his heart and ſoule, ever to doe that which is juſt, and to ſpeake the truth. What then remaineth but to enjoy thy life in a courſe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerence of good actions, one upon another imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly ſucceeding, and never interrupted, though for never ſo little a while?</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. There is but one light of the ſunne, though it be intercepted by walls &amp; mountaines, and other thouſand objects. There is but one common ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the whole World, though it be concluded and reſtrained into ſeverall different bodies, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber infinite. There is but one common ſoule, though divided into innumerable particular eſſences and natures. So is there but one common intellectuall ſoule, though it ſeeme to be divided. And as for all other parts of thoſe Generalls which we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as either ſenſitive ſoules or ſubjects, theſe of themſelves (as naturally irrationall) have no common mutual reference one unto another, though many of them containe a Mind [or, <hi>Reaſonable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>] in them, whereby they are ruled and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned [or, <hi>that hath power and authority over them.</hi>] But of every reaſonable minde, this is the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar nature, that it hath reference to whatſoever is of her owne kinde, and deſireth to be united: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can this common affection, or mutuall unity and correſpondencie, be here intercepted or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or confined to particulars <hi>[as thoſe other common things are.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. What doeſt thou deſire? To live long. What? To enjoy the operations of a ſenſitive ſoule;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:414:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>or of the appetitive Facultie? or wouldſt thou grow, and then decreaſe againe? Wouldſt thou long bee able to talke, to thinck and reaſon with thyſelfe? Which of all theſe ſeemes unto thee a worthy object of thy deſire? Now if of all theſe thou doeſt finde that they be but little worth in themſelves, proceed on unto the laſt, which is, In all things to follow God and Reaſon. But for a man to greeve that by death he ſhall be deprived of any of theſe things, is both againſt God and Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. What a ſmall portion of vaſte and infinite eternitie it is, that is allowed unto euery one of us, and how ſoone it vaniſheth into the generall age of the world: of the common ſubſtance, and of the common ſoule alſo what a ſmall portion is allotted unto us: and in what a little clod of the whole Earth (as it were) it is that thou doeſt crawle. After thou ſhalt rightly have conſidered theſe things with thy ſelfe, phancie not any thing elſe in the world any more to bee of any weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but this, to do that only which thyne owne nature doth require; and to conforme thyſelfe to that which the common Nature doth affoord.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. What is the preſent eſtate of my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? For herein lyeth all indeede. As for all other things, they are without the compaſſe of myne owne will: and if without the compaſſe of my will, then are they as dead things unto me, and as it were mere ſmoake.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. To ſtirre up a man to the contempt of death this among other things, is of good power and efficacie, that even they who eſteemed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:414:128"/>to bee happines, and payne miſerie, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe <hi>[many of them]</hi> contemne death <hi>[as much as any.]</hi> And can death be terrible to him, to whome that only ſeemes good, which <hi>[in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie courſe of nature]</hi> is ſeaſonable? to him, to whome, whether his actions bee many or few, ſo they be all good, is all one; and who whether hee behold the things of the world <hi>[being allwayes the ſame]</hi> either for many years, or for few yeares only, is altogether indifferent? O man! as a Citizen thou haſt lived, and converſed in this great Citty <hi>[the World.]</hi> Whether juſt for ſo many yeares, or no, what is it unto thee? Thou haſt lived (thou maieſt bee ſure) as long as the Lawes, and Orders of the City required; which may bee the common comfort of all. Why then ſhould it bee grievous unto thee, if (not a Tyran, nor an unjuſt Judge, but) the ſame nature that brought thee in, doth now ſend thee out of the world? As if the <hi>Praetor</hi> ſhould fairely diſmiſſe him from the <hi>ſcene</hi> [or, <hi>ſtage</hi>] whom he had taken in to act a while. Oh, but the play is not yet at an end, there are but three Acts yet acted of it? Thou haſt well ſaid: for in matter of life, three Acts is the whole Play. Now to ſet a certain time to every mans acting, belongs unto him only, who as firſt hee was of thy <hi>compoſition,</hi> ſo is now the cauſe of thy diſſolution. As for thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, thou haſt to do with neither. Goe thy wayes then well pleaſed and contented: for ſo is He that diſmiſſeth thee.</p>

                  </gap>. However, that Antoninus by theſe words doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Chriſtians, I thinke probable for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Firſt, becauſe (as appeareth by the ancients) Chriſtians were ordinarily accounted by the Heathens, and Chriſt himſelfe held by them to have beene a great Magician. Secondly, that the Heathens themſelves, not only upon other occaſions, but eſpecially for Daemoniacs, and ſuch as were poſſeſſed, made often uſe of Chriſtians, appeareth by more then one paſſage of Tertullian: and in particular, how Lucilla daughter to this Antoninus, infeſted with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, was cured by one Abercius, Biſhop of Hieropolis; may bee ſeene by the acts and particulars of it yet extant. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſoe thoſe lawes of Antoninus, made againſt them, <hi>qui ſub obtentu &amp; monitu deorum quaedam vel renunciant uel jactant, vel ſcientes effingunt, quo leves hominum animi ſuperſtitione Numinis terreantur,</hi> mentioned by Ulpianus and Modeſtinus, were made againſt Chriſtians, as ſome are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:414:130"/>of opinion, I will not determine. Now if ſoe bee that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus doth here intend the Chriſtians, I doe not ſee, how hee could altogether diſcredit the truth of their ſtraunge and miraculous operations: eſpecially if wee give credit to thoſe Acts extant, not as yet, that I know of, queſtioned by any: and that in generall hee ſhould diſcredit all ſuch operations as were accounted miraculous and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, is much leſſe credible: when as (beſides many good reaſons that might bee given to the contrary:) the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians themſelves (as Athenagoras who then lived) did not deny, but that ſtrange things in that kind were done and brought to paſſe among the very Heathens. <gap reason="foreign">

For both interpretations, probable reaſons may bee given. As for the firſt, That ſuch a man as Antoninus was, ſhould not bee commended by any, for an <hi>officious obſequious man</hi> ſhould bee no wonder, a man would thinke, but rather a wonder if he ſhould. Neither do theſe other titles of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſate ſo well with the perſon of a Prince, that the omiſſion of them ſhould bee noted and recorded, as a matter obſervable. But that ſoe ingenuous a man as Antoninus was, ſhould never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in any other thoſe ſaidparts and faculties mentioned, is not in any mans judgement, I thinke, without ſome wonder; and in the judgement of a Stoick, muſt needs bee very commendable: out of the ſchoole of which Sect proceeded this decree: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; &amp;c. <hi>Never either commend or diſcommend any man for any thing that is common &amp; popular, but onely for his Dogmata or certaine Tenets in point of life and practiſe; for they onely are that which every man may truly account his owne, and that onely wich can make our actions either ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or praiſeworthy:</hi> as by Epictetus in Arrianus, you ſhall finde more then once expreſſed. But now on the other ſide, that which Antoninus not many lines after doth adde of his Fathers care, that all in any profeſſion (as Oratours by name) excellent might according to their deſert bee reputed and reſpected in the world; and that which in the ſixt booke hee doth more cleerely ſet downe of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:414:133"/>ſame among other things, that he was not <hi>Sophiſtes;</hi> doth as pregnantly croſſe and overthrow that former interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Neither is it neceſſary, that what is here ſaid of <hi>Pius,</hi> muſt bee underſtood of him when Emperour; which he was not till the yeare of his life 53. or thereabouts.

That all temporall worldly bleſſings are common both to good and bad, they ſaw. That this, if there were no more in it then ſoe, could not ſtand with Gods juſtice and goodneſſe (which to deny is to deny that there is a God:) they ſaw likewiſe. Upon this ground (a ground that he ſtands much upon, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as farr, as ever any Chriſtian did:) Plato's illation was, That after this life there muſt needs bee a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when both good and bad ſhould according to their deeds be rewarded. The Stoicks, as fully perſwaded, as Plato was, that a God there is, and he a juſt and good God; and yet concerning the future eſtate of the dead, not ſo fully ſatisfied, as he was; to maintaine their beleefe againſt that common exception could finde no better way then to maintaine, that all thoſe things that men uſually did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeke after or fly from, as either good or bad; were in themſelves and in very truth, neither good nor bad, but altogether indifferent So that whether a man was rich or poore, in health or in paine, long lived or ſoone cut off, in honour or diſhonour; that all this was nothing at all to either his happineſſe or unhappines, no not whileſt he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and by conſequent, that it was no argument againſt the goodneſſe and juſtice of God, that theſe things were knowen and grunted to happen unto all promiſcuouſly, whether good or bad, Antoninus doth elſewhere touch upon it againe, as towards the end of the fourth, and about the beginning of the ninth booke. To him (though I intend brevity, yet for further illuſtration of a point of that weight and moment, as hath been the occaſion of ſo many
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:414:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>large volumes, I can doe no leſſe then add Epictetus his words at the leaſt, out of his <hi>Enchirid:</hi> chapter as I finde him by ſome divided, 38. as by others 29. <gap reason="foreign">

So ſhalt thou never complaine of the Gods, or accuſe them as neglected and little cared for by them. But this cannot poſſibly bee, except thou firſt give over all purſuit after thoſe things which are not in our owne power: and that on them only which are in our power and wholy depend on our owne wills, thou bee fully perſwaded, that all that is truly good or evill doth depend.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:414:140"/>could not I well tranſlate it <hi>God;</hi> for ſo muſt I have made him ſay, not only that <hi>God</hi> was a divine effluence, and a particle of <hi>God;</hi> but alſo that God was God; which would have been too groſſe and manifeſt a <hi>tautologie.</hi> The word <hi>Genius</hi> uſed by Xylander, however it might fit in ſome reſpects; and as it is uſed and interpreted by ſome ancients, comes neereſt of any Latin word to Antoninus his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: yet certaine it is, as out of Apuleius may appeare, that it is againſt its proper ſignification, that it is ſo uſed, and in regard of its more popular and ordinary uſe, there could not bee any other more improper and contrary. For whereas there is nothing more ordinary among the Latins then theſe phraſes <hi>Genio indulgere; genium curare, genium defraudare</hi> and the like, in which manner of ſpeeches the word <hi>Genius</hi> is uſed, as the beſt and greateſt motive, to Epicuraean mirth and jovialtie; Antoninus doth alwaies preſſe his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> as the beſt &amp; greateſt motive, and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all manner of temperance, ſobriety, chaſtiry, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, holineſſe and the like. Some will thinke perchance that I might haue reteined the word <hi>Daemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> But ſeeing eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Antoninus his time and before, that word by meanes of the bleſſed Goſpell of Chriſt, was allready become ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely odious to Latin eares, that Apuleius himſelfe, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Heathen, being to write <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (which was Plutarchs title) though he maintained the thing, that it was not a <hi>God</hi> but a direct <hi>Daemon,</hi> of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture far different and inferiour to the <hi>Gods,</hi> yet avoided the word as odious, and of purpoſe, (as is well and at large obſerved by S.

Now for the word <hi>Spirit</hi> which of all others I have made choiſe of, ſome will thinke perchance, that I have made too bold with it, to put it, ſo ſacred a word, in a Heathens mouth ſo often, and to make it ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:414:141"/>a word with him, as it will bee found by my Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Although I could give a more direct and generall anſwer both for Antoninus and my ſelfe, if I would take occaſion here to fall upon that ſubject: yet for brevities ſake, I will content my ſelfe to require that of the Reader, which I thinke no reaſonable man can deny, that to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe an Heathens meaning, I may bee allowed words that have been uſed by Heathens. I thinke that of Seneca, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> makes any queſtion, (notwithſtanding that ancient report an dopinion of many concerning ſome Epiſtles that ſhould paſſe betweene him and S. Paul, which S. Hierome and others ſpeake of;) but that he was a Heathen. His words are theſe <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 41. <hi>Propè eſt a te Deus: tecum eſt: intus eſt.

Bonus vir ſine Deo nemo eſt. &amp;c.</hi> Thus much of the word. Now concerning the thing it ſelfe, how Antoninus came by this philoſophy (ſo much by him in theſe his bookes inculcated) of this inward ſpirit; and ſo to examine Plato's and other ancients opinion concerning the ſame: or how neere either hee or any of them came to the truth, and ſo to heape together many paſſages, and to compare them with ſome like paſſages in the ſcripture; is a thing which I my ſelfe have taken much pleaſure in, and ſome others would perchance, but that would require far more ſcope, then this place can afford mee, and therefore I let it alone.</p>

Seneca is very large upon this ſubject. The truth is: they would not have men to bee men but meere Gods. And whiles they thus went about to elevate this vertue, the crowne of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, to a higher pitch of divine purity and ſimplicity, then humane nature was capable of; and to abſtract from it, as it were, all that was humane and fleſhly; I feare they made many, who were not ſo capable of their diſtinctions and ſubtilties (ſuch as you ſhall find in Seneca upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) the leſſe to regard that, which nature otherwiſe, and to good purpoſe, had made them more capable of. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is and by them confeſſed, that for this very thing, they commonly and their profeſſion had a very hard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.

Now as the multitude of theſe Newington <hi>urnes</hi> (for I doe not remember that ever ſo many in ſo narrow a compaſſe of ground were founds is obſervable; ſo is the manner of their laying in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:414:146"/>ground. They that have been preſent often at their digging up, have obſerved, that where one great <hi>Vrne</hi> is found, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers leſſe veſſels are; ſome within the great, ſome about it: all coverd either with a proper cover of the ſame earth and making as the pott it ſelfe is; or more courſely, but very cloſely ſtopped up with other earth. Of all thoſe ſmall veſſels of what faſhion ſoever that are found either in or about theſe <hi>urnes,</hi> I know no other uſe (to ſatisfie in ſome part their curioſitie, that wonder at them when they ſee them) that was ordinarie among the Romans, but either to conteine ſome fragrant odoriferous liquor, and durable confection; or that <hi>libatie</hi> of wine and milke that they uſed about their dead; or laſtly (not to ſpeake here of thoſe burning lampes that have beene found in ſome ancient urnes and monuments, which ſo many have largely written and diſputed of) to receive and preſerve the teares that were ſhed by the friends of the deceaſed for greefe of their death. As for the difference of the greater &amp; the leſſer urnes, Fabricius in his <hi>Roma,</hi> and Marlianus in his topogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall deſcription of the ſame, are of opinion, that when urnes of different bignes are found in the ſame place, the greater were for the greater and richer, as the maſters and <hi>Patroni;</hi> and the leſſer, for the poorer, and inferiour, as the ſervants and <hi>clientes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In things of this nature, which were I meane, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arbitrarie, there is no queſtion but different faſhions were uſed in different places; yea and likely in the ſame place, as every mans particular conceit, or humor ſerved him. And therefore it were hard to determine any thing as certainly, and generally true. But as for theſe N. urnes, this ſeemes to have beene the cuſtome there uſed. One great urne was appointed to containe the bones and aſhes of all one, either houſhould or kindred. As often therefore as any of them dyed, ſo often had they recourſe unto the common urne, which ſo often was uncovered. To prevent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:414:146"/>this I find that the faſhion hath beene in ſome places, to lett in the aſhes through ſome holes made and fitted for that purpoſe. See Gruter fol. 814. Now beſides the great and common urne, it is likely that every particular perſon that dyed, had ſome leſſe urne or veſſell, particularly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his owne memorie; whereby both the number of the deceaſed, and the parties themſelves might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bee remembred. There might bee alſo another uſe of theſe leſſer pots, in my judgement very neceſſary, and that is, that by them the common great Urnes, might the better bee knowne and diſcerned one from another; which being ſo neare, in ſo ſmall a compaſſe of ground, and not much unlike one another, might otherwiſe eaſily be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. And this is the more likely, becauſe of thoſe many hundreds that have beene taken up of the leſſer ſort, ſcarce have there beene found any, of one and the ſame making, I heare not of any thing that hath hitherto beene found, in theſe Newington urnes beſides bones, and aſhes; and ſometimes cleere water. And ſo doe I reade of <hi>urnes</hi> or Earthen veſſels <hi>plenis limpidiſſimâ aquâ,</hi> that have bene found elſewhere, as that which is mentioned in Gruterus fol. 927. I doubt not but many would be glad (as well as I) to know certainly what this place hath formerly beene. But alas! how ſhould wee <hi>(who are of yeſterday, &amp; know nothing)</hi> without the helpe of ancient records, recall the memorie of things forgotten ſo many hundred of yeares agoe? Thus much wee may certainly enough conclude: Firſt, from the multitude of theſe <hi>urnes,</hi> that it was once a common burying place for the Romans. Secondly, from the Hiſtorie of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in this land, that no <hi>urne</hi> is there found, but is 1200. or 1300 Yeares old, at the leaſt: ſo many ages of men have theſe poore earthen veſſels (of ſo much better clay for durance then human bodies are,) outlaſted both the makers of them, and the perſons to whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory they were conſecrated. Laſtly, from the place, which is upon an aſcent (and for a good way beyond, hilly;) not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:414:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>farre from the Sea, and neere the high way; wee may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme in all probabilitie, that it was once the feate of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtation. If any man can teach me more of it. I ſhall heartily thanck him. Since this was written, I made another journey to the place and ſpent ſome time there in digging, but with no ſucceſſe. However, that I might not returne home emptie, the ſame M. Dearing gave me a piece of urne, which hath this inſcription, FVL LINVS.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That the immortality of the ſoule, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the good and bad after this life was never more ſtoutly maintained by any of all the Heathens, then by Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, is full well knowne and acknowledged by all. But it is objected, that this ſound and true Tenet, he by many odd fictions of his owne, and ridiculous deſcriptions of the torments of the wicked after this life, hath much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted &amp; adulterated. One thing eſpecially, though by more objected againſt him,<note place="margin">Ihcodor.</note> yet by one Greec Father ſpecially is much exaggerated, that in a place where hee treatch of the reward of the juſt and unjuſt after this life, he ſhould there propoſe unto his <hi>Philoſophers</hi> as their beſt reward for their juſtice and piety, the <hi>metompſycoſis</hi> and tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their ſoules into <hi>bees</hi> and <hi>ants,</hi> and ſuch like; a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:414:147"/>thing ſo ſtraunge and ridiculous even to conceive, that I cannot but wonder, how they that could beleeve any ſuch thing of Plato, could in other places find in their hearts ſo highly to extoll, and ſo abſolutely to prefer him before all other Philoſophers that ever were. But as for his many relations, and ſtrange deſcriptions both of the manner and place of torments after this life, I will not take upon mee to excuſe him. Only this I will ſay, that he profeſſing in ſo many places, that what hee related in this kinde, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beleeved himſelfe, nor required of any that they ſhould beleeve; and that he was well content, that ſuch and ſuch relations as theſe, ſhould goe for old womens tales, for that in very deed they were no better; and that all that hee ſtood upon, was, That men might certainly bee perſwaded, that the ſoule was immortall, and that there was a reward for the juſt after this life; but as for the reſt, whether theſe very things or ſomewhat ęquivalent were beleeved, untill they had more certaine information was to him indifferent: I doe not ſee, what could well bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected more from an Heathen. And hee that ſhall compare thoſe many deſcriptions of Hell and Purgatorie, which are to bee found in bookes written many hundred yeares agoe, with his; will cerrainly judge, that either Plato was not much amiſſe, or that many Chriſtians have deſerved farr more blame then hee. And I further thinke that Plato might in this caſe with as much reaſon, to maintaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the vulgar an opinion of the immortality of the ſoule and of a judgement after this life, make uſe of old womens tales; as the Angelicall Doctor againſt ſome Fathers, who affirme the contrary, doth take upon him to maintaine; that <hi>ignis inferni, ejusdem eſt ſpeciei cum igne noſtro,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Supplem. <hi>3.</hi> part. q. <hi>97.</hi> Art. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe Ariſtotle hath written, that <hi>omnis aqua omni aquae eſt idem ſpecie.</hi> And as for that which Plato writes concerning the transformation of worldly carnall mens ſoules, according to Pythagoras doctrine; it is true, that Pythagoras and his opinions being in great eſteeme among the people, Plato
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:414:148"/>not knowing himſelfe what certainly to affirme of the manner of their puniſhment after their death, was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, whether this or that were beleeved, ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what were beleeved; and therefore propoſes ſometimes one opinion, ſome times another. But as for the reward of the juſt and godly, it is an intolerable miſtake. For in that very place which is alleadged, he plainely ſaies that the true Philoſophers after their death <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>are received into the communion and ſociety of the Gods, and are transformed into their very natures.</hi> And though it cannot bee doubted, who they are that Plato calls Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, they being ſo often and ſo amply deſcribed by Him; yet to make the caſe clearer, I will produce his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of them in that very place: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>All true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers abſtaine from all carnall luſts and concupiſcences, &amp;c. They feare not the ruine of their goods and howſes, nor pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as other ordinary men, and ſuch as are addicted to wealth and riches; They feare not the reproach and diſhonour of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate idle life, as they that hunt after honour and glory; for they purpoſely avoide all ſuch things,</hi> &amp;c. The ground (and yet no ground at all, had he beene but looked upon:) of the miſtake, (as appeares by them who have objected this unto him) is, that Plato ſetting downe the ſeverall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations of worldly men, according to their ſeverall diſpoſitions and employments during their life; ſaith that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;c. by which words of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. &amp;c. he was miſtaken as though he had meant them, whom he uſually calls <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,</hi> which in many reſpects was a very groſſe miſtake. For firſt, as was ſaid in the Praeface, it was not the love
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:414:148"/>or exerciſe of vertue alone, that made a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> as they meant it; but the love of a vertue <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and ſo diſtinguiſhed them from politick worldly men, who (not to ſpeake of the vaine glorious:) often exerciſe juſtice, &amp; many other vertues, not out of any love to them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as the times are, it may bee moſt advantageous for them, to ſhew themſelves in their actions juſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. And from the Epicuraeans, who though they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged not divine providence, nor immortality of the ſoule, and propoſed vnto themſelves pleaſure as the only end of their lives; yet maintained (moſt of them) that they that were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or, <hi>lovers of pleaſure,</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity bee, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or, <hi>without vertue</hi> it was not poſſible for a man to live in true pleaſure. And certaine it is that the Epicureans have written as many excellent bookes to exhort men to vertue, &amp; for the moſt part, in the ſight of the world lived as well as any of any other ſect: ſo that as it was ſaid of the Stoicks (for they were moſt of them notable hypocrites) that they did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of the Epicuraeans it was ſayd, that they did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Then it was further to bee obſerved that Plato doth not ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> abſolutely, but, <gap reason="foreign">

But that which plainly pats all out of doubt, and makes the miſtake in a manner inexcuſable, is, that Plato after theſe words, preſently addes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and in the words immediately following, ſetts downe thoſe that he calls <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> as men of a quite different ſect &amp; profeſſion; which they that object this place vnto him, confound with the former.</p>

It was an error of the Stoi ks (forſaking herein the more ſound doctrine of ancienter Philoſophers, as Plato, Ariſtotle, and others:) that in ſome caſes it was not only lawfull, but alſo laudable for a man to make himſelfe away. I do not find that our Antoninus doth any where abſolutely and directly oppoſe this error; but this I find and any man may obſerve that ſhall read him, that in many places hee doth reſtraine the caſe with ſuch limitations and reſtrictions, as might ſeeme in ſome manner equivalent to a plaine and direct oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

But much more ſhall wee be induced to beare with Antoninus his many repetitions in this kind, if wee further conſider, that all that hee did aime at by all theſe words, was meerly to take downe the pride and haughtie ſpirit of the common Stoicks of his dayes, and before. Many of whom both by their owne practiſe, and by their doctrine and exhortations, did teach a man generally upon all occaſions, but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of death eſpecially, rather to bee deſperatly ſtout and reſolute; then rationally and really wiſe: which made Antoninus in almoſt all his exhortations and inſtructions ſo carefully to inculcat <hi>humilitie</hi> and <hi>a meeke ſpirit.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

They that are any thing acquainted with Senecas ſtile and <hi>genius</hi> of writing, will eaſily make a Comment upon this. But not to go from this very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of death, that we are now upon, how does he ſet out his Cato, his great and almoſt only patterne of wiſedome? <hi>Tam</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>non tantum Caeſari, ſed ſibi iratus, nudas in vulnus manus egit, &amp; genero ſum illum contemptoremque om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis potentiae ſpiritum non emiſit, ſed ejecit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 24. Is this to dye like a Philoſopher or a wiſe man, or rather like a deſperat wretch? If any man ſhall anſwer for S. that hee wrote this as an Orator rather then a Philoſopher, I grant indeede that it was wit that he affected more then ſound wiſedome, (in this and many ſuch paſſages I meane:) but yet it is in the perſon of a Philoſopher that he ſpeakes it; &amp; whether it were a good Orators part to adſcribe ſuch a paſſionat (that I ſay not deſperat;) &amp; diſcontented end to ſuch a perfect wiſe man, as he would have Cato reputed, I leave to others to judge.</p>
               <p>The other maine condition that Antoninus doth generally
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:414:151"/>ſtand upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as hath been ſaid) is, <hi>rationally,</hi> or, <hi>not inconſideratly.</hi> A man may undervalue life as well as overprize it. It was Ariſtotles opinion that a man <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the more vertuous he is, and the better furniſhed with all manner of rare perfections, the more unwilling he muſt needs be to dye. And certainly according to trueth and ſound Philoſophie, for a man to contemne life, and either in a meer bravado (as many duelliſts, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions perſons often do:) to caſt it away; or otherwiſe eaſily and ſlightly upon no ground of ſound reaſon and good rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocination, to part with it, muſt needs be the higheſt degree of madnes &amp; meere brutiſhnes, that can bee conceived. As on the other ſide, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>(as Epictetus upon this occaſion ſpeaketh:) when apparant reaſon doth induce us for ſome greater good, (as either for a better life, or for the performance of ſome duty which in reaſon ought to be dearer unto us then life:) not to regard it, for a man then through either feare of death or love of this world, to linger and to draw back, is great baſeneſſe and greater folly. As for that Antoninus doth here alleage the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as an exemple of that phrenzie that bee doth taxe and reproove; the ground of it is, the ſervent zeale of the primitive Chriſtians, whole love to Chriſt was ſuch, that they not onely were content to ſuffer for him, when they were called to it, but even ſo longed to dye for him, that they could hardly by the Church Canons and diſcipline provided in that behalf be reſtrained from <hi>offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> to death, &amp; being their owne accuſers &amp; promooters. In ſo much that in Africa at a certaine time when they flocked by multitudes to the Inquiſitors or Judges, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of that Province amazed cryed out, <hi>O wretched creatures, if you muſt needs dye, have you no halters or prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices at home?</hi> as is recorded by Tertull. ad <hi>Scap.</hi> laſt chapter. And though this courſe was by the better learned and more ſober praelats inhibited and reſtrained, yet ſuch was commonly their conſtancie and their readines to death whenſoever they were apprehended and condemned by their perſecuters, Yea their joy and exultation ſuch, (<hi>Deo
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:414:151"/>gratias,</hi> or, <hi>God be praiſed,</hi> was their common and ſolemne word, when their ſentence was read;) that that alone was ſufficient to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

Neither indeed were the Chriſtians better knowne unto the Heathens by any other propertie then this, that they were a kind of people, that did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their lives.
